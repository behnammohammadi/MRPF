<ACT><TITLE>ACT I</TITLE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE I.  Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA's palace.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, but this dotage of our general's</LINE>
<LINE>O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>That o'er the files and musters of the war</LINE>
<LINE>Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,</LINE>
<LINE>The office and devotion of their view</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst</LINE>
<LINE>The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,</LINE>
<LINE>And is become the bellows and the fan</LINE>
<LINE>To cool a gipsy's lust.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies,
the Train, with Eunuchs fanning her</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Look, where they come:</LINE>
<LINE>Take but good note, and you shall see in him.</LINE>
<LINE>The triple pillar of the world transform'd</LINE>
<LINE>Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it be love indeed, tell me how much.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter an Attendant</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Attendant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>News, my good lord, from Rome.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Grates me: the sum.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, hear them, Antony:</LINE>
<LINE>Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows</LINE>
<LINE>If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent</LINE>
<LINE>His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;</LINE>
<LINE>Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;</LINE>
<LINE>Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How, my love!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Perchance! nay, and most like:</LINE>
<LINE>You must not stay here longer, your dismission</LINE>
<LINE>Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.</LINE>
<LINE>Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?</LINE>
<LINE>Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine</LINE>
<LINE>Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame</LINE>
<LINE>When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch</LINE>
<LINE>Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.</LINE>
<LINE>Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike</LINE>
<LINE>Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life</LINE>
<LINE>Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Embracing</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,</LINE>
<LINE>On pain of punishment, the world to weet</LINE>
<LINE>We stand up peerless.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Excellent falsehood!</LINE>
<LINE>Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?</LINE>
<LINE>I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony</LINE>
<LINE>Will be himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But stirr'd by Cleopatra.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,</LINE>
<LINE>Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:</LINE>
<LINE>There's not a minute of our lives should stretch</LINE>
<LINE>Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear the ambassadors.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, wrangling queen!</LINE>
<LINE>Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,</LINE>
<LINE>To weep; whose every passion fully strives</LINE>
<LINE>To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!</LINE>
<LINE>No messenger, but thine; and all alone</LINE>
<LINE>To-night we'll wander through the streets and note</LINE>
<LINE>The qualities of people. Come, my queen;</LINE>
<LINE>Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with
their train</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEMETRIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>He comes too short of that great property</LINE>
<LINE>Which still should go with Antony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEMETRIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am full sorry</LINE>
<LINE>That he approves the common liar, who</LINE>
<LINE>Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope</LINE>
<LINE>Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  The same. Another room.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a Soothsayer</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas,</LINE>
<LINE>almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer</LINE>
<LINE>that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew</LINE>
<LINE>this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns</LINE>
<LINE>with garlands!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Soothsayer!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your will?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In nature's infinite book of secrecy</LINE>
<LINE>A little I can read.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Show him your hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough</LINE>
<LINE>Cleopatra's health to drink.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good sir, give me good fortune.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I make not, but foresee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray, then, foresee me one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall be yet far fairer than you are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He means in flesh.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, you shall paint when you are old.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wrinkles forbid!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Vex not his prescience; be attentive.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hush!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall be more beloving than beloved.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I had rather heat my liver with drinking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, hear him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married</LINE>
<LINE>to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:</LINE>
<LINE>let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry</LINE>
<LINE>may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius</LINE>
<LINE>Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O excellent! I love long life better than figs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune</LINE>
<LINE>Than that which is to approach.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then belike my children shall have no names:</LINE>
<LINE>prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If every of your wishes had a womb.</LINE>
<LINE>And fertile every wish, a million.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, come, tell Iras hers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We'll know all our fortunes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall</LINE>
<LINE>be--drunk to bed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful</LINE>
<LINE>prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,</LINE>
<LINE>tell her but a worky-day fortune.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your fortunes are alike.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But how, but how? give me particulars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Soothsayer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have said.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than</LINE>
<LINE>I, where would you choose it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not in my husband's nose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come,</LINE>
<LINE>his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman</LINE>
<LINE>that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let</LINE>
<LINE>her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst</LINE>
<LINE>follow worse, till the worst of all follow him</LINE>
<LINE>laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good</LINE>
<LINE>Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a</LINE>
<LINE>matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!</LINE>
<LINE>for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man</LINE>
<LINE>loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a</LINE>
<LINE>foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep</LINE>
<LINE>decorum, and fortune him accordingly!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me a</LINE>
<LINE>cuckold, they would make themselves whores, but</LINE>
<LINE>they'ld do't!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hush! here comes Antony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not he; the queen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CLEOPATRA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Saw you my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was he not here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden</LINE>
<LINE>A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Seek him, and bring him hither.</LINE>
<LINE>Where's Alexas?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, at your service. My lord approaches.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We will not look upon him: go with us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter MARK ANTONY with a Messenger and Attendants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Against my brother Lucius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay:</LINE>
<LINE>But soon that war had end, and the time's state</LINE>
<LINE>Made friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose better issue in the war, from Italy,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the first encounter, drave them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, what worst?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The nature of bad news infects the teller.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When it concerns the fool or coward. On:</LINE>
<LINE>Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:</LINE>
<LINE>Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,</LINE>
<LINE>I hear him as he flatter'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Labienus--</LINE>
<LINE>This is stiff news--hath, with his Parthian force,</LINE>
<LINE>Extended Asia from Euphrates;</LINE>
<LINE>His conquering banner shook from Syria</LINE>
<LINE>To Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Antony, thou wouldst say,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, my lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue:</LINE>
<LINE>Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;</LINE>
<LINE>Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults</LINE>
<LINE>With such full licence as both truth and malice</LINE>
<LINE>Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,</LINE>
<LINE>When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told us</LINE>
<LINE>Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At your noble pleasure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Attendant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The man from Sicyon,--is there such an one?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Attendant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He stays upon your will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let him appear.</LINE>
<LINE>These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,</LINE>
<LINE>Or lose myself in dotage.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter another Messenger</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What are you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fulvia thy wife is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where died she?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In Sicyon:</LINE>
<LINE>Her length of sickness, with what else more serious</LINE>
<LINE>Importeth thee to know, this bears.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Gives a letter</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Forbear me.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Second Messenger</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:</LINE>
<LINE>What our contempt doth often hurl from us,</LINE>
<LINE>We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,</LINE>
<LINE>By revolution lowering, does become</LINE>
<LINE>The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;</LINE>
<LINE>The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.</LINE>
<LINE>I must from this enchanting queen break off:</LINE>
<LINE>Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,</LINE>
<LINE>My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's your pleasure, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must with haste from hence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then, we kill all our women:</LINE>
<LINE>we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;</LINE>
<LINE>if they suffer our departure, death's the word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must be gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were</LINE>
<LINE>pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between</LINE>
<LINE>them and a great cause, they should be esteemed</LINE>
<LINE>nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of</LINE>
<LINE>this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty</LINE>
<LINE>times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is</LINE>
<LINE>mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon</LINE>
<LINE>her, she hath such a celerity in dying.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She is cunning past man's thought.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit ALEXAS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but</LINE>
<LINE>the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her</LINE>
<LINE>winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater</LINE>
<LINE>storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this</LINE>
<LINE>cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a</LINE>
<LINE>shower of rain as well as Jove.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would I had never seen her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece</LINE>
<LINE>of work; which not to have been blest withal would</LINE>
<LINE>have discredited your travel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fulvia is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fulvia is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fulvia!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When</LINE>
<LINE>it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man</LINE>
<LINE>from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;</LINE>
<LINE>comforting therein, that when old robes are worn</LINE>
<LINE>out, there are members to make new. If there were</LINE>
<LINE>no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,</LINE>
<LINE>and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned</LINE>
<LINE>with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new</LINE>
<LINE>petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion</LINE>

<LINE>The business she hath broached in the state</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And the business you have broached here cannot be</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more light answers. Let our officers</LINE>
<LINE>Have notice what we purpose. I shall break</LINE>
<LINE>The cause of our expedience to the queen,</LINE>
<LINE>And get her leave to part. For not alone</LINE>
<LINE>The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,</LINE>
<LINE>Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too</LINE>
<LINE>Of many our contriving friends in Rome</LINE>
<LINE>Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius</LINE>
<LINE>Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands</LINE>
<LINE>The empire of the sea: our slippery people,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose love is never link'd to the deserver</LINE>
<LINE>Till his deserts are past, begin to throw</LINE>
<LINE>Pompey the Great and all his dignities</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his son; who, high in name and power,</LINE>
<LINE>Higher than both in blood and life, stands up</LINE>
<LINE>For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,</LINE>
<LINE>The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,</LINE>
<LINE>And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,</LINE>
<LINE>To such whose place is under us, requires</LINE>
<LINE>Our quick remove from hence.</LINE>

<LINE>Where is he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did not see him since.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See where he is, who's with him, what he does:</LINE>
<LINE>I did not send you: if you find him sad,</LINE>
<LINE>Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report</LINE>
<LINE>That I am sudden sick: quick, and return.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit ALEXAS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,</LINE>
<LINE>You do not hold the method to enforce</LINE>
<LINE>The like from him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What should I do, I do not?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In each thing give him way, cross him nothing.</LINE>

<LINE>Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear:</LINE>
<LINE>In time we hate that which we often fear.</LINE>
<LINE>But here comes Antony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter MARK ANTONY</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sick and sullen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall:</LINE>
<LINE>It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature</LINE>
<LINE>Will not sustain it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, my dearest queen,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray you, stand further from me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know, by that same eye, there's some good news.</LINE>
<LINE>What says the married woman? You may go:</LINE>
<LINE>Would she had never given you leave to come!</LINE>
<LINE>Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here:</LINE>
<LINE>I have no power upon you; hers you are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The gods best know,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, never was there queen</LINE>
<LINE>So mightily betray'd! yet at the first</LINE>
<LINE>I saw the treasons planted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cleopatra,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why should I think you can be mine and true,</LINE>
<LINE>Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,</LINE>
<LINE>Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,</LINE>
<LINE>To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,</LINE>
<LINE>Which break themselves in swearing!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most sweet queen,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,</LINE>
<LINE>But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,</LINE>
<LINE>Then was the time for words: no going then;</LINE>
<LINE>Eternity was in our lips and eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor,</LINE>
<LINE>But was a race of heaven: they are so still,</LINE>
<LINE>Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,</LINE>
<LINE>Art turn'd the greatest liar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, lady!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know</LINE>
<LINE>There were a heart in Egypt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear me, queen:</LINE>
<LINE>The strong necessity of time commands</LINE>
<LINE>Our services awhile; but my full heart</LINE>
<LINE>Remains in use with you. Our Italy</LINE>
<LINE>Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius</LINE>
<LINE>Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:</LINE>
<LINE>Equality of two domestic powers</LINE>
<LINE>Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,</LINE>
<LINE>Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey,</LINE>
<LINE>Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,</LINE>
<LINE>Into the hearts of such as have not thrived</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;</LINE>
<LINE>And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge</LINE>
<LINE>By any desperate change: my more particular,</LINE>
<LINE>And that which most with you should safe my going,</LINE>
<LINE>Is Fulvia's death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Though age from folly could not give me freedom,</LINE>
<LINE>It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She's dead, my queen:</LINE>
<LINE>Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read</LINE>
<LINE>The garboils she awaked; at the last, best:</LINE>
<LINE>See when and where she died.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O most false love!</LINE>
<LINE>Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill</LINE>
<LINE>With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,</LINE>
<LINE>In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know</LINE>
<LINE>The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,</LINE>
<LINE>As you shall give the advice. By the fire</LINE>
<LINE>That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence</LINE>
<LINE>Thy soldier, servant; making peace or war</LINE>
<LINE>As thou affect'st.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cut my lace, Charmian, come;</LINE>
<LINE>But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well,</LINE>
<LINE>So Antony loves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My precious queen, forbear;</LINE>
<LINE>And give true evidence to his love, which stands</LINE>
<LINE>An honourable trial.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So Fulvia told me.</LINE>
<LINE>I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,</LINE>
<LINE>Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears</LINE>
<LINE>Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene</LINE>
<LINE>Of excellent dissembling; and let it look</LINE>
<LINE>Life perfect honour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You'll heat my blood: no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You can do better yet; but this is meetly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by my sword,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And target. Still he mends;</LINE>
<LINE>But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,</LINE>
<LINE>How this Herculean Roman does become</LINE>
<LINE>The carriage of his chafe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll leave you, lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Courteous lord, one word.</LINE>
<LINE>Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:</LINE>
<LINE>Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it;</LINE>
<LINE>That you know well: something it is I would,</LINE>
<LINE>O, my oblivion is a very Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>And I am all forgotten.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But that your royalty</LINE>
<LINE>Holds idleness your subject, I should take you</LINE>
<LINE>For idleness itself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis sweating labour</LINE>
<LINE>To bear such idleness so near the heart</LINE>
<LINE>As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;</LINE>
<LINE>Since my becomings kill me, when they do not</LINE>
<LINE>Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.</LINE>
<LINE>And all the gods go with you! upon your sword</LINE>
<LINE>Sit laurel victory! and smooth success</LINE>
<LINE>Be strew'd before your feet!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let us go. Come;</LINE>
<LINE>Our separation so abides, and flies,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,</LINE>
<LINE>And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away!</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE IV.  Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter, LEPIDUS,
and their Train</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,</LINE>
<LINE>It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate</LINE>
<LINE>Our great competitor: from Alexandria</LINE>
<LINE>This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes</LINE>
<LINE>The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like</LINE>
<LINE>Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy</LINE>
<LINE>More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or</LINE>
<LINE>Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there</LINE>
<LINE>A man who is the abstract of all faults</LINE>
<LINE>That all men follow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must not think there are</LINE>
<LINE>Evils enow to darken all his goodness:</LINE>
<LINE>His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary,</LINE>
<LINE>Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,</LINE>
<LINE>Than what he chooses.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not</LINE>
<LINE>Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;</LINE>
<LINE>To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit</LINE>
<LINE>And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;</LINE>
<LINE>To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet</LINE>
<LINE>With knaves that smell of sweat: say this</LINE>
<LINE>becomes him,--</LINE>
<LINE>As his composure must be rare indeed</LINE>
<LINE>Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony</LINE>
<LINE>No way excuse his soils, when we do bear</LINE>
<LINE>So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd</LINE>
<LINE>His vacancy with his voluptuousness,</LINE>
<LINE>Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,</LINE>
<LINE>Call on him for't: but to confound such time,</LINE>
<LINE>That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud</LINE>
<LINE>As his own state and ours,--'tis to be chid</LINE>
<LINE>As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,</LINE>
<LINE>Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,</LINE>
<LINE>And so rebel to judgment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's more news.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,</LINE>
<LINE>Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report</LINE>
<LINE>How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;</LINE>
<LINE>And it appears he is beloved of those</LINE>
<LINE>That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports</LINE>
<LINE>The discontents repair, and men's reports</LINE>
<LINE>Give him much wrong'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I should have known no less.</LINE>
<LINE>It hath been taught us from the primal state,</LINE>
<LINE>That he which is was wish'd until he were;</LINE>
<LINE>And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,</LINE>
<LINE>Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,</LINE>
<LINE>Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,</LINE>
<LINE>To rot itself with motion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Caesar, I bring thee word,</LINE>
<LINE>Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,</LINE>
<LINE>Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound</LINE>
<LINE>With keels of every kind: many hot inroads</LINE>
<LINE>They make in Italy; the borders maritime</LINE>
<LINE>Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:</LINE>
<LINE>No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon</LINE>
<LINE>Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more</LINE>
<LINE>Than could his war resisted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once</LINE>
<LINE>Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st</LINE>
<LINE>Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel</LINE>
<LINE>Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,</LINE>
<LINE>Though daintily brought up, with patience more</LINE>
<LINE>Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink</LINE>
<LINE>The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle</LINE>
<LINE>Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign</LINE>
<LINE>The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,</LINE>
<LINE>The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps</LINE>
<LINE>It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,</LINE>
<LINE>Which some did die to look on: and all this--</LINE>
<LINE>It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--</LINE>
<LINE>Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek</LINE>
<LINE>So much as lank'd not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis pity of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let his shames quickly</LINE>
<LINE>Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain</LINE>
<LINE>Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end</LINE>
<LINE>Assemble we immediate council: Pompey</LINE>
<LINE>Thrives in our idleness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To-morrow, Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly</LINE>
<LINE>Both what by sea and land I can be able</LINE>
<LINE>To front this present time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Till which encounter,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantime</LINE>
<LINE>Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>To let me be partaker.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>MARDIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's your highness' pleasure?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure</LINE>
<LINE>In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee,</LINE>
<LINE>That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARDIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, gracious madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARDIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing</LINE>
<LINE>But what indeed is honest to be done:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet have I fierce affections, and think</LINE>
<LINE>What Venus did with Mars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Charmian,</LINE>
<LINE>Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?</LINE>
<LINE>Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?</LINE>
<LINE>O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!</LINE>
<LINE>Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?</LINE>
<LINE>The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm</LINE>
<LINE>And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,</LINE>
<LINE>Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'</LINE>
<LINE>For so he calls me: now I feed myself</LINE>
<LINE>With most delicious poison. Think on me,</LINE>
<LINE>That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,</LINE>
<LINE>And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>When thou wast here above the ground, I was</LINE>
<LINE>A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey</LINE>
<LINE>Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;</LINE>
<LINE>There would he anchor his aspect and die</LINE>
<LINE>With looking on his life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ALEXAS, from OCTAVIUS CAESAR</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sovereign of Egypt, hail!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath</LINE>
<LINE>With his tinct gilded thee.</LINE>
<LINE>How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Last thing he did, dear queen,</LINE>
<LINE>He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--</LINE>
<LINE>This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mine ear must pluck it thence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEXAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Good friend,' quoth he,</LINE>
<LINE>'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends</LINE>
<LINE>This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,</LINE>
<LINE>To mend the petty present, I will piece</LINE>
<LINE>Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,</LINE>
<LINE>Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,</LINE>
<LINE>And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,</LINE>
<LINE>Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke</LINE>
<LINE>Was beastly dumb'd by him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, was he sad or merry?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O well-divided disposition! Note him,</LINE>
<LINE>Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:</LINE>
<LINE>He was not sad, for he would shine on those</LINE>
<LINE>That make their looks by his; he was not merry,</LINE>
<LINE>Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay</LINE>
<LINE>In Egypt with his joy; but between both:</LINE>
<LINE>O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,</LINE>
<LINE>The violence of either thee becomes,</LINE>
<LINE>So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in
warlike manner</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If the great gods be just, they shall assist</LINE>
<LINE>The deeds of justest men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENECRATES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know, worthy Pompey,</LINE>
<LINE>That what they do delay, they not deny.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays</LINE>
<LINE>The thing we sue for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENECRATES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We, ignorant of ourselves,</LINE>
<LINE>Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers</LINE>
<LINE>Deny us for our good; so find we profit</LINE>
<LINE>By losing of our prayers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall do well:</LINE>
<LINE>The people love me, and the sea is mine;</LINE>
<LINE>My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope</LINE>
<LINE>Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony</LINE>
<LINE>In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make</LINE>
<LINE>No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where</LINE>
<LINE>He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,</LINE>
<LINE>Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor either cares for him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Caesar and Lepidus</LINE>
<LINE>Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where have you this? 'tis false.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From Silvius, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He dreams: I know they are in Rome together,</LINE>
<LINE>Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,</LINE>
<LINE>Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!</LINE>
<LINE>Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!</LINE>
<LINE>Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,</LINE>
<LINE>Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks</LINE>
<LINE>Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;</LINE>
<LINE>That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour</LINE>
<LINE>Even till a Lethe'd dulness!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter VARRIUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now, Varrius!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VARRIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is most certain that I shall deliver:</LINE>
<LINE>Mark Antony is every hour in Rome</LINE>
<LINE>Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis</LINE>
<LINE>A space for further travel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I could have given less matter</LINE>
<LINE>A better ear. Menas, I did not think</LINE>
<LINE>This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm</LINE>
<LINE>For such a petty war: his soldiership</LINE>
<LINE>Is twice the other twain: but let us rear</LINE>
<LINE>The higher our opinion, that our stirring</LINE>
<LINE>Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck</LINE>
<LINE>The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot hope</LINE>
<LINE>Caesar and Antony shall well greet together:</LINE>
<LINE>His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;</LINE>
<LINE>His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,</LINE>
<LINE>Not moved by Antony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not, Menas,</LINE>
<LINE>How lesser enmities may give way to greater.</LINE>
<LINE>Were't not that we stand up against them all,</LINE>
<LINE>'Twere pregnant they should square between</LINE>
<LINE>themselves;</LINE>
<LINE>For they have entertained cause enough</LINE>
<LINE>To draw their swords: but how the fear of us</LINE>
<LINE>May cement their divisions and bind up</LINE>
<LINE>The petty difference, we yet not know.</LINE>
<LINE>Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands</LINE>
<LINE>Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, Menas.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  Rome. The house of LEPIDUS.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,</LINE>
<LINE>And shall become you well, to entreat your captain</LINE>
<LINE>To soft and gentle speech.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall entreat him</LINE>
<LINE>To answer like himself: if Caesar move him,</LINE>
<LINE>Let Antony look over Caesar's head</LINE>
<LINE>And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,</LINE>
<LINE>Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,</LINE>
<LINE>I would not shave't to-day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis not a time</LINE>
<LINE>For private stomaching.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Every time</LINE>
<LINE>Serves for the matter that is then born in't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But small to greater matters must give way.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not if the small come first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your speech is passion:</LINE>
<LINE>But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes</LINE>
<LINE>The noble Antony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And yonder, Caesar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If we compose well here, to Parthia:</LINE>
<LINE>Hark, Ventidius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not know,</LINE>
<LINE>Mecaenas; ask Agrippa.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Noble friends,</LINE>
<LINE>That which combined us was most great, and let not</LINE>
<LINE>A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,</LINE>
<LINE>May it be gently heard: when we debate</LINE>
<LINE>Our trivial difference loud, we do commit</LINE>
<LINE>Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,</LINE>
<LINE>The rather, for I earnestly beseech,</LINE>
<LINE>Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor curstness grow to the matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis spoken well.</LINE>
<LINE>Were we before our armies, and to fight.</LINE>
<LINE>I should do thus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome to Rome.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thank you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sit, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I learn, you take things ill which are not so,</LINE>
<LINE>Or being, concern you not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must be laugh'd at,</LINE>
<LINE>If, or for nothing or a little, I</LINE>
<LINE>Should say myself offended, and with you</LINE>
<LINE>Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at, that I should</LINE>
<LINE>Once name you derogately, when to sound your name</LINE>
<LINE>It not concern'd me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My being in Egypt, Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>What was't to you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more than my residing here at Rome</LINE>
<LINE>Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there</LINE>
<LINE>Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt</LINE>
<LINE>Might be my question.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How intend you, practised?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may be pleased to catch at mine intent</LINE>
<LINE>By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother</LINE>
<LINE>Made wars upon me; and their contestation</LINE>
<LINE>Was theme for you, you were the word of war.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You do mistake your business; my brother never</LINE>
<LINE>Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;</LINE>
<LINE>And have my learning from some true reports,</LINE>
<LINE>That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather</LINE>
<LINE>Discredit my authority with yours;</LINE>
<LINE>And make the wars alike against my stomach,</LINE>
<LINE>Having alike your cause? Of this my letters</LINE>
<LINE>Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,</LINE>
<LINE>As matter whole you have not to make it with,</LINE>
<LINE>It must not be with this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You praise yourself</LINE>
<LINE>By laying defects of judgment to me; but</LINE>
<LINE>You patch'd up your excuses.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so, not so;</LINE>
<LINE>I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,</LINE>
<LINE>Very necessity of this thought, that I,</LINE>
<LINE>Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,</LINE>
<LINE>Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars</LINE>
<LINE>Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,</LINE>
<LINE>I would you had her spirit in such another:</LINE>
<LINE>The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle</LINE>
<LINE>You may pace easy, but not such a wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would we had all such wives, that the men might go</LINE>
<LINE>to wars with the women!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar</LINE>
<LINE>Made out of her impatience, which not wanted</LINE>
<LINE>Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant</LINE>
<LINE>Did you too much disquiet: for that you must</LINE>
<LINE>But say, I could not help it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wrote to you</LINE>
<LINE>When rioting in Alexandria; you</LINE>
<LINE>Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts</LINE>
<LINE>Did gibe my missive out of audience.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir,</LINE>
<LINE>He fell upon me ere admitted: then</LINE>
<LINE>Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want</LINE>
<LINE>Of what I was i' the morning: but next day</LINE>
<LINE>I told him of myself; which was as much</LINE>
<LINE>As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow</LINE>
<LINE>Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,</LINE>
<LINE>Out of our question wipe him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have broken</LINE>
<LINE>The article of your oath; which you shall never</LINE>
<LINE>Have tongue to charge me with.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Soft, Caesar!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No,</LINE>
<LINE>Lepidus, let him speak:</LINE>
<LINE>The honour is sacred which he talks on now,</LINE>
<LINE>Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar;</LINE>
<LINE>The article of my oath.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To lend me arms and aid when I required them;</LINE>
<LINE>The which you both denied.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neglected, rather;</LINE>
<LINE>And then when poison'd hours had bound me up</LINE>
<LINE>From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty</LINE>
<LINE>Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power</LINE>
<LINE>Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,</LINE>
<LINE>To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;</LINE>
<LINE>For which myself, the ignorant motive, do</LINE>
<LINE>So far ask pardon as befits mine honour</LINE>
<LINE>To stoop in such a case.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis noble spoken.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MECAENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it might please you, to enforce no further</LINE>
<LINE>The griefs between ye: to forget them quite</LINE>
<LINE>Were to remember that the present need</LINE>
<LINE>Speaks to atone you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Worthily spoken, Mecaenas.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or, if you borrow one another's love for the</LINE>
<LINE>instant, you may, when you hear no more words of</LINE>
<LINE>Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to</LINE>
<LINE>wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go to, then; your considerate stone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not much dislike the matter, but</LINE>
<LINE>The manner of his speech; for't cannot be</LINE>
<LINE>We shall remain in friendship, our conditions</LINE>
<LINE>So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew</LINE>
<LINE>What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge</LINE>
<LINE>O' the world I would pursue it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGRIPPA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me leave, Caesar,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak, Agrippa.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGRIPPA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,</LINE>
<LINE>Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony</LINE>
<LINE>Is now a widower.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say not so, Agrippa:</LINE>
<LINE>If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof</LINE>
<LINE>Were well deserved of rashness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am not married, Caesar: let me hear</LINE>
<LINE>Agrippa further speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGRIPPA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To hold you in perpetual amity,</LINE>
<LINE>To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts</LINE>
<LINE>With an unslipping knot, take Antony</LINE>
<LINE>Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims</LINE>
<LINE>No worse a husband than the best of men;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose virtue and whose general graces speak</LINE>
<LINE>That which none else can utter. By this marriage,</LINE>
<LINE>All little jealousies, which now seem great,</LINE>
<LINE>And all great fears, which now import their dangers,</LINE>
<LINE>Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,</LINE>
<LINE>Where now half tales be truths: her love to both</LINE>
<LINE>Would, each to other and all loves to both,</LINE>
<LINE>Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;</LINE>
<LINE>For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,</LINE>
<LINE>By duty ruminated.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will Caesar speak?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd</LINE>
<LINE>With what is spoke already.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What power is in Agrippa,</LINE>
<LINE>If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'</LINE>
<LINE>To make this good?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The power of Caesar, and</LINE>
<LINE>His power unto Octavia.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May I never</LINE>
<LINE>To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,</LINE>
<LINE>Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:</LINE>
<LINE>Further this act of grace: and from this hour</LINE>
<LINE>The heart of brothers govern in our loves</LINE>
<LINE>And sway our great designs!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is my hand.</LINE>
<LINE>A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother</LINE>
<LINE>Did ever love so dearly: let her live</LINE>
<LINE>To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never</LINE>
<LINE>Fly off our loves again!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Happily, amen!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;</LINE>
<LINE>For he hath laid strange courtesies and great</LINE>
<LINE>Of late upon me: I must thank him only,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;</LINE>
<LINE>At heel of that, defy him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Time calls upon's:</LINE>
<LINE>Of us must Pompey presently be sought,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else he seeks out us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where lies he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>About the mount Misenum.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is his strength by land?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Great and increasing: but by sea</LINE>
<LINE>He is an absolute master.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So is the fame.</LINE>
<LINE>Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we</LINE>
<LINE>The business we have talk'd of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With most gladness:</LINE>
<LINE>And do invite you to my sister's view,</LINE>
<LINE>Whither straight I'll lead you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let us, Lepidus,</LINE>
<LINE>Not lack your company.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Noble Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>Not sickness should detain me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY,
and LEPIDUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MECAENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome from Egypt, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! My</LINE>
<LINE>honourable friend, Agrippa!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGRIPPA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Enobarbus!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MECAENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have cause to be glad that matters are so well</LINE>
<LINE>digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, and</LINE>
<LINE>made the night light with drinking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MECAENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and</LINE>
<LINE>but twelve persons there; is this true?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much more</LINE>
<LINE>monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MECAENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to</LINE>
<LINE>her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up</LINE>
<LINE>his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGRIPPA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devised</LINE>
<LINE>well for her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will tell you.</LINE>
<LINE>The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,</LINE>
<LINE>Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;</LINE>
<LINE>Purple the sails, and so perfumed that</LINE>
<LINE>The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,</LINE>
<LINE>Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made</LINE>
<LINE>The water which they beat to follow faster,</LINE>
<LINE>As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,</LINE>
<LINE>It beggar'd all description: she did lie</LINE>
<LINE>In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--</LINE>
<LINE>O'er-picturing that Venus where we see</LINE>
<LINE>The fancy outwork nature: on each side her</LINE>
<LINE>Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,</LINE>
<LINE>With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem</LINE>
<LINE>To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,</LINE>
<LINE>And what they undid did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGRIPPA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, rare for Antony!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,</LINE>
<LINE>So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>And made their bends adornings: at the helm</LINE>
<LINE>A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle</LINE>
<LINE>Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,</LINE>
<LINE>That yarely frame the office. From the barge</LINE>
<LINE>A strange invisible perfume hits the sense</LINE>
<LINE>Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast</LINE>
<LINE>Her people out upon her; and Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,</LINE>
<LINE>Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,</LINE>
<LINE>Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,</LINE>
<LINE>And made a gap in nature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGRIPPA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Rare Egyptian!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,</LINE>
<LINE>Invited her to supper: she replied,</LINE>
<LINE>It should be better he became her guest;</LINE>
<LINE>Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,</LINE>
<LINE>Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,</LINE>
<LINE>And for his ordinary pays his heart</LINE>
<LINE>For what his eyes eat only.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGRIPPA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Royal wench!</LINE>
<LINE>She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:</LINE>
<LINE>He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I saw her once</LINE>
<LINE>Hop forty paces through the public street;</LINE>
<LINE>And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,</LINE>
<LINE>That she did make defect perfection,</LINE>
<LINE>And, breathless, power breathe forth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Thou kill'st thy mistress: but well and free,</LINE>

<LINE>I do not like 'But yet,' it does allay</LINE>

<LINE>Wherefore my father should revengers want,</LINE>
<LINE>Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,</LINE>
<LINE>There saw you labouring for him. What was't</LINE>
<LINE>That moved pale Cassius to conspire; and what</LINE>
<LINE>Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,</LINE>
<LINE>With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom,</LINE>

<LINE>You have made me offer</LINE>
<LINE>Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must</LINE>

<LINE>The praise of it by telling, you must know,</LINE>
<LINE>When Caesar and your brother were at blows,</LINE>
<LINE>Your mother came to Sicily and did find</LINE>
<LINE>Her welcome friendly.</LINE>

<LINE>Grew fat with feasting there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have heard much.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have fair meanings, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And fair words to them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then so much have I heard:</LINE>
<LINE>And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more of that: he did so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, I pray you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well;</LINE>
<LINE>And well am like to do; for, I perceive,</LINE>
<LINE>Four feasts are toward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me shake thy hand;</LINE>
<LINE>I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,</LINE>
<LINE>When I have envied thy behavior.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir,</LINE>
<LINE>I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,</LINE>
<LINE>When you have well deserved ten times as much</LINE>
<LINE>As I have said you did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Enjoy thy plainness,</LINE>
<LINE>It nothing ill becomes thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Aboard my galley I invite you all:</LINE>
<LINE>Will you lead, lords?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Show us the way, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have</LINE>
<LINE>made this treaty.--You and I have known, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At sea, I think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have done well by water.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And you by land.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will praise any man that will praise me; though it</LINE>
<LINE>cannot be denied what I have done by land.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor what I have done by water.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, something you can deny for your own</LINE>
<LINE>safety: you have been a great thief by sea.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And you by land.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There I deny my land service. But give me your</LINE>
<LINE>hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they</LINE>
<LINE>might take two thieves kissing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But there is never a fair woman has a true face.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No slander; they steal hearts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We came hither to fight with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.</LINE>
<LINE>Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony</LINE>
<LINE>here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Caesar's sister is called Octavia.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray ye, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would</LINE>
<LINE>not prophesy so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think the policy of that purpose made more in the</LINE>
<LINE>marriage than the love of the parties.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think so too. But you shall find, the band that</LINE>
<LINE>seems to tie their friendship together will be the</LINE>
<LINE>very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a</LINE>
<LINE>holy, cold, and still conversation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who would not have his wife so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.</LINE>
<LINE>He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the</LINE>
<LINE>sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as</LINE>
<LINE>I said before, that which is the strength of their</LINE>
<LINE>amity shall prove the immediate author of their</LINE>
<LINE>variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:</LINE>
<LINE>he married but his occasion here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?</LINE>
<LINE>I have a health for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, let's away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE VII.  On board POMPEY's galley, off Misenum.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Music plays. Enter two or three Servants with
a banquet</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are</LINE>
<LINE>ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world</LINE>
<LINE>will blow them down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lepidus is high-coloured.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They have made him drink alms-drink.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As they pinch one another by the disposition, he</LINE>
<LINE>cries out 'No more;' reconciles them to his</LINE>
<LINE>entreaty, and himself to the drink.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But it raises the greater war between him and</LINE>
<LINE>his discretion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, this is to have a name in great men's</LINE>
<LINE>fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do</LINE>
<LINE>me no service as a partisan I could not heave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen</LINE>
<LINE>to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be,</LINE>
<LINE>which pitifully disaster the cheeks.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK
ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MECAENAS,
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MENAS, with other captains</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To OCTAVIUS CAESAR</STAGEDIR>  Thus do they, sir: they take</LINE>
<LINE>the flow o' the Nile</LINE>
<LINE>By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know,</LINE>
<LINE>By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth</LINE>
<LINE>Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,</LINE>
<LINE>The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,</LINE>
<LINE>And shortly comes to harvest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You've strange serpents there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, Lepidus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the</LINE>
<LINE>operation of your sun: so is your crocodile.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sit,--and some wine! A health to Lepidus!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'</LINE>
<LINE>pyramises are very goodly things; without</LINE>
<LINE>contradiction, I have heard that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to POMPEY</STAGEDIR>  Pompey, a word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to MENAS</STAGEDIR>                 Say in mine ear:</LINE>
<LINE>what is't?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to POMPEY</STAGEDIR>  Forsake thy seat, I do beseech</LINE>
<LINE>thee, captain,</LINE>
<LINE>And hear me speak a word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to MENAS</STAGEDIR>  Forbear me till anon.</LINE>
<LINE>This wine for Lepidus!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What manner o' thing is your crocodile?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broad</LINE>
<LINE>as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,</LINE>
<LINE>and moves with its own organs: it lives by that</LINE>
<LINE>which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of</LINE>
<LINE>it, it transmigrates.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What colour is it of?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of it own colour too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis a strange serpent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will this description satisfy him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a</LINE>
<LINE>very epicure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to MENAS</STAGEDIR>  Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of</LINE>
<LINE>that? away!</LINE>
<LINE>Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to POMPEY</STAGEDIR>  If for the sake of merit thou</LINE>
<LINE>wilt hear me,</LINE>
<LINE>Rise from thy stool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to MENAS</STAGEDIR>  I think thou'rt mad.</LINE>
<LINE>The matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Rises, and walks aside</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?</LINE>
<LINE>Be jolly, lords.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These quick-sands, Lepidus,</LINE>
<LINE>Keep off them, for you sink.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wilt thou be lord of all the world?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What say'st thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How should that be?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But entertain it,</LINE>
<LINE>And, though thou think me poor, I am the man</LINE>
<LINE>Will give thee all the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hast thou drunk well?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove:</LINE>
<LINE>Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,</LINE>
<LINE>Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Show me which way.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These three world-sharers, these competitors,</LINE>
<LINE>Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;</LINE>
<LINE>And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:</LINE>
<LINE>All there is thine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, this thou shouldst have done,</LINE>
<LINE>And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany;</LINE>
<LINE>In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;</LINE>
<LINE>Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,</LINE>
<LINE>I should have found it afterwards well done;</LINE>
<LINE>But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  For this,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.</LINE>
<LINE>Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall never find it more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This health to Lepidus!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's to thee, Menas!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Enobarbus, welcome!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fill till the cup be hid.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's a strong fellow, Menas.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'st</LINE>
<LINE>not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,</LINE>
<LINE>That it might go on wheels!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Drink thou; increase the reels.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?</LINE>
<LINE>Here is to Caesar!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I could well forbear't.</LINE>
<LINE>It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,</LINE>
<LINE>And it grows fouler.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be a child o' the time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Possess it, I'll make answer:</LINE>
<LINE>But I had rather fast from all four days</LINE>
<LINE>Than drink so much in one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha, my brave emperor!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To MARK ANTONY</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,</LINE>
<LINE>And celebrate our drink?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let's ha't, good soldier.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, let's all take hands,</LINE>
<LINE>Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense</LINE>
<LINE>In soft and delicate Lethe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All take hands.</LINE>
<LINE>Make battery to our ears with the loud music:</LINE>
<LINE>The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;</LINE>
<LINE>The holding every man shall bear as loud</LINE>
<LINE>As his strong sides can volley.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them
hand in hand</STAGEDIR>
<SUBHEAD>THE SONG.</SUBHEAD>
<LINE>Come, thou monarch of the vine,</LINE>
<LINE>Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!</LINE>
<LINE>In thy fats our cares be drown'd,</LINE>
<LINE>With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:</LINE>
<LINE>Cup us, till the world go round,</LINE>
<LINE>Cup us, till the world go round!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,</LINE>
<LINE>Let me request you off: our graver business</LINE>
<LINE>Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;</LINE>
<LINE>You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb</LINE>
<LINE>Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost</LINE>
<LINE>Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.</LINE>
<LINE>Good Antony, your hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll try you on the shore.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And shall, sir; give's your hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POMPEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>You have my father's house,--But, what? we are friends.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, down into the boat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take heed you fall not.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and MENAS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Menas, I'll not on shore.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, to my cabin.</LINE>
<LINE>These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!</LINE>
<LINE>Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell</LINE>
<LINE>To these great fellows: sound and be hang'd, sound out!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Sound a flourish, with drums</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ho! says a' There's my cap.</LINE>

<ACT><TITLE>ACT III</TITLE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE I.  A plain in Syria.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph, with SILIUS,
and other Romans, Officers, and Soldiers; the dead
body of PACORUS borne before him</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VENTIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now</LINE>
<LINE>Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death</LINE>
<LINE>Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body</LINE>
<LINE>Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,</LINE>
<LINE>Pays this for Marcus Crassus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Noble Ventidius,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,</LINE>
<LINE>The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,</LINE>
<LINE>Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither</LINE>
<LINE>The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony</LINE>
<LINE>Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and</LINE>
<LINE>Put garlands on thy head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VENTIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Silius, Silius,</LINE>
<LINE>I have done enough; a lower place, note well,</LINE>
<LINE>May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;</LINE>
<LINE>Better to leave undone, than by our deed</LINE>
<LINE>Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.</LINE>
<LINE>Caesar and Antony have ever won</LINE>
<LINE>More in their officer than person: Sossius,</LINE>
<LINE>One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,</LINE>
<LINE>For quick accumulation of renown,</LINE>
<LINE>Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.</LINE>
<LINE>Who does i' the wars more than his captain can</LINE>
<LINE>Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,</LINE>
<LINE>The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,</LINE>
<LINE>Than gain which darkens him.</LINE>
<LINE>I could do more to do Antonius good,</LINE>
<LINE>But 'twould offend him; and in his offence</LINE>
<LINE>Should my performance perish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast, Ventidius,</LINE>
<LINE>that</LINE>
<LINE>Without the which a soldier, and his sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VENTIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll humbly signify what in his name,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They have dispatch'd with Pompey, he is gone;</LINE>
<LINE>The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps</LINE>
<LINE>To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,</LINE>
<LINE>Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled</LINE>

<LINE>His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,</LINE>

<LINE>Let not the piece of virtue, which is set</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt us as the cement of our love,</LINE>
<LINE>To keep it builded, be the ram to batter</LINE>

<LINE>Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,--</LINE>

<LINE>Of semblable import,--but he hath waged</LINE>
<LINE>New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it</LINE>
<LINE>To public ear:</LINE>
<LINE>Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not</LINE>
<LINE>But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly</LINE>
<LINE>He vented them; most narrow measure lent me:</LINE>
<LINE>When the best hint was given him, he not took't,</LINE>
<LINE>Or did it from his teeth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O my good lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Believe not all; or, if you must believe,</LINE>

<LINE>If this division chance, ne'er stood between,</LINE>
<LINE>Praying for both parts:</LINE>
<LINE>The good gods me presently,</LINE>
<LINE>When I shall pray, 'O bless my lord and husband!'</LINE>

<LINE>Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,</LINE>
<LINE>Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady,</LINE>

<LINE>Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold</LINE>
<LINE>Were publicly enthroned: at the feet sat</LINE>
<LINE>Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,</LINE>

<LINE>Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,</LINE>

<LINE>Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire</LINE>
<LINE>Up to a whore; who now are levying</LINE>

<LINE>O'er your content these strong necessities;</LINE>
<LINE>But let determined things to destiny</LINE>
<LINE>Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing more dear to me. You are abused</LINE>

<LINE>Is it not strange, Canidius,</LINE>

<LINE>Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she</LINE>

<LINE>Or take his life there: this if she perform,</LINE>
<LINE>She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Think, and die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is Antony or we in fault for this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Antony only, that would make his will</LINE>
<LINE>Lord of his reason. What though you fled</LINE>
<LINE>From that great face of war, whose several ranges</LINE>
<LINE>Frighted each other? why should he follow?</LINE>
<LINE>The itch of his affection should not then</LINE>
<LINE>Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,</LINE>
<LINE>When half to half the world opposed, he being</LINE>
<LINE>The meered question: 'twas a shame no less</LINE>
<LINE>Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,</LINE>
<LINE>And leave his navy gazing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee, peace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter MARK ANTONY with EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is that his answer?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EUPHRONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The queen shall then have courtesy, so she</LINE>
<LINE>Will yield us up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EUPHRONIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He says so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let her know't.</LINE>
<LINE>To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,</LINE>
<LINE>And he will fill thy wishes to the brim</LINE>
<LINE>With principalities.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That head, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To him again: tell him he wears the rose</LINE>
<LINE>Of youth upon him; from which the world should note</LINE>
<LINE>Something particular: his coin, ships, legions,</LINE>
<LINE>May be a coward's; whose ministers would prevail</LINE>
<LINE>Under the service of a child as soon</LINE>
<LINE>As i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore</LINE>
<LINE>To lay his gay comparisons apart,</LINE>
<LINE>And answer me declined, sword against sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt MARK ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar will</LINE>
<LINE>Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show,</LINE>
<LINE>Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are</LINE>
<LINE>A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward</LINE>
<LINE>Do draw the inward quality after them,</LINE>
<LINE>To suffer all alike. That he should dream,</LINE>
<LINE>Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will</LINE>
<LINE>Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued</LINE>
<LINE>His judgment too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter an Attendant</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Attendant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A messenger from CAESAR.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, no more ceremony? See, my women!</LINE>
<LINE>Against the blown rose may they stop their nose</LINE>
<LINE>That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Attendant</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Mine honesty and I begin to square.</LINE>
<LINE>The loyalty well held to fools does make</LINE>
<LINE>Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure</LINE>
<LINE>To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord</LINE>
<LINE>Does conquer him that did his master conquer</LINE>
<LINE>And earns a place i' the story.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter THYREUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Caesar's will?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THYREUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear it apart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>None but friends: say boldly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THYREUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, haply, are they friends to Antony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;</LINE>
<LINE>Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master</LINE>
<LINE>Will leap to be his friend: for us, you know,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THYREUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats,</LINE>
<LINE>Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,</LINE>
<LINE>Further than he is Caesar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go on: right royal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THYREUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He knows that you embrace not Antony</LINE>
<LINE>As you did love, but as you fear'd him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THYREUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The scars upon your honour, therefore, he</LINE>
<LINE>Does pity, as constrained blemishes,</LINE>
<LINE>Not as deserved.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is a god, and knows</LINE>
<LINE>What is most right: mine honour was not yielded,</LINE>
<LINE>But conquer'd merely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>             To be sure of that,</LINE>
<LINE>I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,</LINE>
<LINE>That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for</LINE>
<LINE>Thy dearest quit thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THYREUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I say to Caesar</LINE>
<LINE>What you require of him? for he partly begs</LINE>
<LINE>To be desired to give. It much would please him,</LINE>
<LINE>That of his fortunes you should make a staff</LINE>
<LINE>To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,</LINE>
<LINE>To hear from me you had left Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>And put yourself under his shrowd,</LINE>
<LINE>The universal landlord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's your name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THYREUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My name is Thyreus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most kind messenger,</LINE>
<LINE>Say to great Caesar this: in deputation</LINE>
<LINE>I kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am prompt</LINE>
<LINE>To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:</LINE>
<LINE>Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear</LINE>
<LINE>The doom of Egypt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THYREUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis your noblest course.</LINE>
<LINE>Wisdom and fortune combating together,</LINE>
<LINE>If that the former dare but what it can,</LINE>
<LINE>No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay</LINE>
<LINE>My duty on your hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your Caesar's father oft,</LINE>
<LINE>When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,</LINE>
<LINE>Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,</LINE>

<LINE>Approach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods</LINE>
<LINE>and devils!</LINE>
<LINE>Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'</LINE>
<LINE>Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,</LINE>
<LINE>And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Attendants</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Than with an old one dying.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>

<LINE>That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them</LINE>
<LINE>So saucy with the hand of she here,--what's her name,</LINE>
<LINE>Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,</LINE>
<LINE>Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Attendants with THYREUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!</LINE>
<LINE>Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>Forborne the getting of a lawful race,</LINE>
<LINE>And by a gem of women, to be abused</LINE>
<LINE>By one that looks on feeders?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my lord,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have been a boggler ever:</LINE>
<LINE>But when we in our viciousness grow hard--</LINE>
<LINE>O misery on't!--the wise gods seel our eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us</LINE>
<LINE>Adore our errors; laugh at's, while we strut</LINE>
<LINE>To our confusion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, is't come to this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I found you as a morsel cold upon</LINE>
<LINE>Dead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment</LINE>
<LINE>Of Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,</LINE>
<LINE>Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have</LINE>
<LINE>Luxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,</LINE>
<LINE>Though you can guess what temperance should be,</LINE>
<LINE>You know not what it is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherefore is this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To let a fellow that will take rewards</LINE>
<LINE>And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with</LINE>
<LINE>My playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal</LINE>
<LINE>And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar</LINE>
<LINE>The horned herd! for I have savage cause;</LINE>
<LINE>And to proclaim it civilly, were like</LINE>
<LINE>A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank</LINE>
<LINE>For being yare about him.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>First Attendant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Soundly, my lord.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Attendant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He did ask favour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If that thy father live, let him repent</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry</LINE>
<LINE>To follow Caesar in his triumph, since</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth</LINE>
<LINE>The white hand of a lady fever thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say</LINE>
<LINE>He makes me angry with him; for he seems</LINE>
<LINE>Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,</LINE>
<LINE>Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;</LINE>
<LINE>And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,</LINE>
<LINE>When my good stars, that were my former guides,</LINE>
<LINE>Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires</LINE>
<LINE>Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike</LINE>
<LINE>My speech and what is done, tell him he has</LINE>
<LINE>Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom</LINE>
<LINE>He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,</LINE>
<LINE>As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:</LINE>
<LINE>Hence with thy stripes, begone!</LINE>

<LINE>Alack, our terrene moon</LINE>
<LINE>Is now eclipsed; and it portends alone</LINE>
<LINE>The fall of Antony!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must stay his time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Not know me yet?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cold-hearted toward me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, dear, if I be so,</LINE>
<LINE>From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,</LINE>
<LINE>And poison it in the source; and the first stone</LINE>
<LINE>Drop in my neck: as it determines, so</LINE>
<LINE>Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!</LINE>
<LINE>Till by degrees the memory of my womb,</LINE>
<LINE>Together with my brave Egyptians all,</LINE>
<LINE>By the discandying of this pelleted storm,</LINE>
<LINE>Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile</LINE>
<LINE>Have buried them for prey!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am satisfied.</LINE>
<LINE>Caesar sits down in Alexandria; where</LINE>
<LINE>I will oppose his fate. Our force by land</LINE>
<LINE>Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy too</LINE>
<LINE>Have knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like.</LINE>
<LINE>Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?</LINE>
<LINE>If from the field I shall return once more</LINE>
<LINE>To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;</LINE>
<LINE>I and my sword will earn our chronicle:</LINE>
<LINE>There's hope in't yet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's my brave lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed,</LINE>
<LINE>And fight maliciously: for when mine hours</LINE>
<LINE>Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives</LINE>
<LINE>Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,</LINE>
<LINE>And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,</LINE>
<LINE>Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me</LINE>
<LINE>All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;</LINE>
<LINE>Let's mock the midnight bell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is my birth-day:</LINE>
<LINE>I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lord</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We will yet do well.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force</LINE>
<LINE>The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;</LINE>
<LINE>There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll make death love me; for I will contend</LINE>
<LINE>Even with his pestilent scythe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,</LINE>
<LINE>Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that mood</LINE>
<LINE>The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,</LINE>
<LINE>A diminution in our captain's brain</LINE>
<LINE>Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason,</LINE>
<LINE>It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek</LINE>

<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He calls me boy; and chides, as he had power</LINE>

<LINE>I have many other ways to die; meantime</LINE>
<LINE>Laugh at his challenge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MECAENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Caesar must think,</LINE>
<LINE>When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted</LINE>

<LINE>Swallows have built</LINE>
<LINE>In Cleopatra's sails their nests: the augurers</LINE>
<LINE>Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,</LINE>
<LINE>And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony</LINE>

<LINE>All is lost;</LINE>
<LINE>This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me:</LINE>

<LINE>They cast their caps up and carouse together</LINE>
<LINE>Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore!</LINE>
<LINE>'tis thou</LINE>
<LINE>Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart</LINE>
<LINE>Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;</LINE>
<LINE>For when I am revenged upon my charm,</LINE>
<LINE>I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit SCARUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more:</LINE>
<LINE>Fortune and Antony part here; even here</LINE>

<LINE>Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets</LINE>
<LINE>On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd,</LINE>
<LINE>That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:</LINE>
<LINE>O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,--</LINE>
<LINE>Whose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,--</LINE>
<LINE>Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,</LINE>

<LINE>Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown</LINE>

<LINE>The shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me,</LINE>
<LINE>Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage:</LINE>
<LINE>Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon;</LINE>
<LINE>And with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club,</LINE>
<LINE>Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die:</LINE>

<SPEAKER>EROS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, noble lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;</LINE>
<LINE>A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,</LINE>
<LINE>A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,</LINE>
<LINE>A forked mountain, or blue promontory</LINE>
<LINE>With trees upon't, that nod unto the world,</LINE>
<LINE>And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen</LINE>
<LINE>these signs;</LINE>
<LINE>They are black vesper's pageants.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EROS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my lord,</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That which is now a horse, even with a thought</LINE>
<LINE>The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,</LINE>
<LINE>As water is in water.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EROS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It does, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My good knave Eros, now thy captain is</LINE>
<LINE>Even such a body: here I am Antony:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.</LINE>
<LINE>I made these wars for Egypt: and the queen,--</LINE>
<LINE>Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine;</LINE>
<LINE>Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto't</LINE>
<LINE>A million more, now lost,--she, Eros, has</LINE>
<LINE>Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory</LINE>
<LINE>Unto an enemy's triumph.</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us</LINE>
<LINE>Ourselves to end ourselves.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter MARDIAN</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O! thy vile lady!</LINE>
<LINE>She has robb'd me of my sword.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARDIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, Antony;</LINE>
<LINE>My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingled</LINE>
<LINE>With thine entirely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!</LINE>
<LINE>She hath betray'd me and shall die the death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARDIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Death of one person can be paid but once,</LINE>
<LINE>And that she has discharged: what thou wouldst do</LINE>
<LINE>Is done unto thy hand: the last she spake</LINE>
<LINE>Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'</LINE>
<LINE>Then in the midst a tearing groan did break</LINE>
<LINE>The name of Antony; it was divided</LINE>
<LINE>Between her heart and lips: she render'd life,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy name so buried in her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dead, then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Does pay thy labour richly; go.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit MARDIAN</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep</LINE>
<LINE>The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!</LINE>
<LINE>Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,</LINE>
<LINE>Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.</LINE>
<LINE>No more a soldier: bruised pieces, go;</LINE>
<LINE>You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit EROS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and</LINE>
<LINE>Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now</LINE>
<LINE>All length is torture: since the torch is out,</LINE>
<LINE>Lie down, and stray no farther: now all labour</LINE>
<LINE>Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles</LINE>
<LINE>Itself with strength: seal then, and all is done.</LINE>
<LINE>Eros!--I come, my queen:--Eros!--Stay for me:</LINE>
<LINE>Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,</LINE>
<LINE>And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Since Cleopatra died,</LINE>
<LINE>I have lived in such dishonour, that the gods</LINE>
<LINE>Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword</LINE>
<LINE>Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back</LINE>
<LINE>With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack</LINE>
<LINE>The courage of a woman; less noble mind</LINE>
<LINE>Than she which by her death our Caesar tells</LINE>
<LINE>'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,</LINE>
<LINE>That, when the exigent should come, which now</LINE>
<LINE>Is come indeed, when I should see behind me</LINE>
<LINE>The inevitable prosecution of</LINE>
<LINE>Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.</LINE>
<LINE>Put colour in thy cheek.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EROS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The gods withhold me!</LINE>
<LINE>Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,</LINE>
<LINE>Though enemy, lost aim, and could not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Eros,</LINE>
<LINE>Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see</LINE>
<LINE>Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down</LINE>
<LINE>His corrigible neck, his face subdued</LINE>
<LINE>To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat</LINE>
<LINE>Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded</LINE>
<LINE>His baseness that ensued?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EROS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would not see't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.</LINE>
<LINE>Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn</LINE>
<LINE>Most useful for thy country.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EROS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, pardon me!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then</LINE>
<LINE>To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;</LINE>
<LINE>Or thy precedent services are all</LINE>
<LINE>But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>My captain, and my emperor, let me say,</LINE>
<LINE>Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARK ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thrice-nobler than myself!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what</LINE>
<LINE>I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros</LINE>
<LINE>Have by their brave instruction got upon me</LINE>
<LINE>A nobleness in record: but I will be</LINE>
<LINE>A bridegroom in my death, and run into't</LINE>
<LINE>As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Falling on his sword</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?</LINE>

<LINE>Wishes were ever fools,--O, come, come, come;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>They heave MARK ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded</LINE>
<LINE>By such poor passion as the maid that milks</LINE>
<LINE>And does the meanest chares. It were for me</LINE>
<LINE>To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;</LINE>
<LINE>To tell them that this world did equal theirs</LINE>
<LINE>Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;</LINE>
<LINE>Patience is scottish, and impatience does</LINE>
<LINE>Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin</LINE>
<LINE>To rush into the secret house of death,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?</LINE>
<LINE>What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!</LINE>
<LINE>My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,</LINE>
<LINE>Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:</LINE>
<LINE>We'll bury him; and then, what's brave,</LINE>
<LINE>what's noble,</LINE>
<LINE>Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,</LINE>
<LINE>And make death proud to take us. Come, away:</LINE>
<LINE>This case of that huge spirit now is cold:</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, women, women! come; we have no friend</LINE>
<LINE>But resolution, and the briefest end.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MECAENAS,
GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, and others, his council of war</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;</LINE>
<LINE>Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter DERCETAS, with the sword of MARK ANTONY</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest</LINE>
<LINE>Appear thus to us?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DERCETAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am call'd Dercetas;</LINE>
<LINE>Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy</LINE>
<LINE>Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,</LINE>
<LINE>He was my master; and I wore my life</LINE>
<LINE>To spend upon his haters. If thou please</LINE>
<LINE>To take me to thee, as I was to him</LINE>
<LINE>I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,</LINE>
<LINE>I yield thee up my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is't thou say'st?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DERCETAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The breaking of so great a thing should make</LINE>
<LINE>A greater crack: the round world</LINE>
<LINE>Should have shook lions into civil streets,</LINE>
<LINE>And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony</LINE>
<LINE>Is not a single doom; in the name lay</LINE>
<LINE>A moiety of the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DERCETAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is dead, Caesar:</LINE>
<LINE>Not by a public minister of justice,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Which writ his honour in the acts it did,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,</LINE>
<LINE>Splitted the heart. This is his sword;</LINE>
<LINE>I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd</LINE>
<LINE>With his most noble blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look you sad, friends?</LINE>
<LINE>The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings</LINE>
<LINE>To wash the eyes of kings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGRIPPA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And strange it is,</LINE>
<LINE>That nature must compel us to lament</LINE>
<LINE>Our most persisted deeds.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MECAENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His taints and honours</LINE>
<LINE>Waged equal with him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGRIPPA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A rarer spirit never</LINE>
<LINE>Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us</LINE>
<LINE>Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MECAENAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When such a spacious mirror's set before him,</LINE>
<LINE>He needs must see himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Antony!</LINE>
<LINE>I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance</LINE>
<LINE>Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce</LINE>
<LINE>Have shown to thee such a declining day,</LINE>
<LINE>Or look on thine; we could not stall together</LINE>
<LINE>In the whole world: but yet let me lament,</LINE>
<LINE>With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou, my brother, my competitor</LINE>
<LINE>In top of all design, my mate in empire,</LINE>
<LINE>Friend and companion in the front of war,</LINE>
<LINE>The arm of mine own body, and the heart</LINE>
<LINE>Where mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars,</LINE>
<LINE>Unreconciliable, should divide</LINE>
<LINE>Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends--</LINE>
<LINE>But I will tell you at some meeter season:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter an Egyptian</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The business of this man looks out of him;</LINE>
<LINE>We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Egyptian</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,</LINE>
<LINE>Confined in all she has, her monument,</LINE>
<LINE>Of thy intents desires instruction,</LINE>
<LINE>That she preparedly may frame herself</LINE>
<LINE>To the way she's forced to.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bid her have good heart:</LINE>
<LINE>She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,</LINE>
<LINE>How honourable and how kindly we</LINE>
<LINE>Determine for her; for Caesar cannot live</LINE>
<LINE>To be ungentle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Egyptian</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So the gods preserve thee!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,</LINE>
<LINE>We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts</LINE>
<LINE>The quality of her passion shall require,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke</LINE>
<LINE>She do defeat us; for her life in Rome</LINE>
<LINE>Would be eternal in our triumph: go,</LINE>
<LINE>And with your speediest bring us what she says,</LINE>
<LINE>And how you find of her.</LINE>

<LINE>Go with me to my tent; where you shall see</LINE>
<LINE>How hardly I was drawn into this war;</LINE>
<LINE>How calm and gentle I proceeded still</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and IRAS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My desolation does begin to make</LINE>
<LINE>A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;</LINE>
<LINE>Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,</LINE>
<LINE>A minister of her will: and it is great</LINE>
<LINE>To do that thing that ends all other deeds;</LINE>
<LINE>Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;</LINE>
<LINE>Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,</LINE>
<LINE>The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS,
GALLUS and Soldiers</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROCULEIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt;</LINE>
<LINE>And bids thee study on what fair demands</LINE>
<LINE>Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's thy name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROCULEIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My name is Proculeius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Antony</LINE>
<LINE>Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but</LINE>
<LINE>I do not greatly care to be deceived,</LINE>
<LINE>That have no use for trusting. If your master</LINE>
<LINE>Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,</LINE>
<LINE>That majesty, to keep decorum, must</LINE>
<LINE>No less beg than a kingdom: if he please</LINE>
<LINE>To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,</LINE>
<LINE>He gives me so much of mine own, as I</LINE>
<LINE>Will kneel to him with thanks.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROCULEIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be of good cheer;</LINE>
<LINE>You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing:</LINE>
<LINE>Make your full reference freely to my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Who is so full of grace, that it flows over</LINE>
<LINE>On all that need: let me report to him</LINE>
<LINE>Your sweet dependency; and you shall find</LINE>
<LINE>A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness,</LINE>
<LINE>Where he for grace is kneel'd to.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray you, tell him</LINE>
<LINE>I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him</LINE>
<LINE>The greatness he has got. I hourly learn</LINE>
<LINE>A doctrine of obedience; and would gladly</LINE>
<LINE>Look him i' the face.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROCULEIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This I'll report, dear lady.</LINE>
<LINE>Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied</LINE>
<LINE>Of him that caused it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GALLUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You see how easily she may be surprised:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Here PROCULEIUS and two of the Guard ascend the
monument by a ladder placed against a window, and,
having descended, come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of
the Guard unbar and open the gates</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>To PROCULEIUS and the Guard</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Guard her till Caesar come.</LINE>

<LINE>Hold, worthy lady, hold:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Seizes and disarms her</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this</LINE>
<LINE>Relieved, but not betray'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, of death too,</LINE>
<LINE>That rids our dogs of languish?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROCULEIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cleopatra,</LINE>
<LINE>Do not abuse my master's bounty by</LINE>
<LINE>The undoing of yourself: let the world see</LINE>
<LINE>His nobleness well acted, which your death</LINE>
<LINE>Will never let come forth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where art thou, death?</LINE>
<LINE>Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queen</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROCULEIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, temperance, lady!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;</LINE>
<LINE>If idle talk will once be necessary,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,</LINE>
<LINE>Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I</LINE>
<LINE>Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor once be chastised with the sober eye</LINE>
<LINE>Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up</LINE>
<LINE>And show me to the shouting varletry</LINE>
<LINE>Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt</LINE>
<LINE>Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud</LINE>
<LINE>Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies</LINE>
<LINE>Blow me into abhorring! rather make</LINE>
<LINE>My country's high pyramides my gibbet,</LINE>
<LINE>And hang me up in chains!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROCULEIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You do extend</LINE>
<LINE>These thoughts of horror further than you shall</LINE>
<LINE>Find cause in Caesar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter DOLABELLA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOLABELLA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Proculeius,</LINE>
<LINE>What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,</LINE>
<LINE>And he hath sent for thee: for the queen,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll take her to my guard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROCULEIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, Dolabella,</LINE>
<LINE>It shall content me best: be gentle to her.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To CLEOPATRA</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,</LINE>
<LINE>If you'll employ me to him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Say, I would die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt PROCULEIUS and Soldiers</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOLABELLA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most noble empress, you have heard of me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot tell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOLABELLA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Assuredly you know me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.</LINE>
<LINE>You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;</LINE>
<LINE>Is't not your trick?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOLABELLA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I understand not, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:</LINE>
<LINE>O, such another sleep, that I might see</LINE>
<LINE>But such another man!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOLABELLA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it might please ye,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck</LINE>
<LINE>A sun and moon, which kept their course,</LINE>
<LINE>and lighted</LINE>
<LINE>The little O, the earth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOLABELLA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most sovereign creature,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm</LINE>
<LINE>Crested the world: his voice was propertied</LINE>
<LINE>As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;</LINE>
<LINE>But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,</LINE>
<LINE>He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,</LINE>
<LINE>There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas</LINE>
<LINE>That grew the more by reaping: his delights</LINE>
<LINE>Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above</LINE>
<LINE>The element they lived in: in his livery</LINE>
<LINE>Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were</LINE>
<LINE>As plates dropp'd from his pocket.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOLABELLA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cleopatra!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Think you there was, or might be, such a man</LINE>
<LINE>As this I dream'd of?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOLABELLA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentle madam, no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.</LINE>
<LINE>But, if there be, or ever were, one such,</LINE>
<LINE>It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff</LINE>
<LINE>To vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagine</LINE>
<LINE>And Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,</LINE>
<LINE>Condemning shadows quite.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOLABELLA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear me, good madam.</LINE>
<LINE>Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it</LINE>
<LINE>As answering to the weight: would I might never</LINE>
<LINE>O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,</LINE>
<LINE>By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites</LINE>
<LINE>My very heart at root.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank you, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Know you what Caesar means to do with me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Nay, pray you, sir,--</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOLABELLA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Though he be honourable,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He'll lead me, then, in triumph?</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Sir, the gods</LINE>
<LINE>Will have it thus; my master and my lord</LINE>
<LINE>I must obey.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take to you no hard thoughts:</LINE>
<LINE>The record of what injuries you did us,</LINE>
<LINE>Though written in our flesh, we shall remember</LINE>
<LINE>As things but done by chance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sole sir o' the world,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot project mine own cause so well</LINE>
<LINE>To make it clear; but do confess I have</LINE>
<LINE>Been laden with like frailties which before</LINE>
<LINE>Have often shamed our sex.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cleopatra, know,</LINE>
<LINE>We will extenuate rather than enforce:</LINE>
<LINE>If you apply yourself to our intents,</LINE>
<LINE>Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find</LINE>
<LINE>A benefit in this change; but if you seek</LINE>
<LINE>To lay on me a cruelty, by taking</LINE>
<LINE>Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself</LINE>
<LINE>Of my good purposes, and put your children</LINE>
<LINE>To that destruction which I'll guard them from,</LINE>
<LINE>If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,</LINE>
<LINE>Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall</LINE>
<LINE>Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,</LINE>
<LINE>I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;</LINE>
<LINE>Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SELEUCUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his peril, that I have reserved</LINE>
<LINE>To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SELEUCUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam,</LINE>
<LINE>I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,</LINE>
<LINE>Speak that which is not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What have I kept back?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SELEUCUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Enough to purchase what you have made known.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve</LINE>
<LINE>Your wisdom in the deed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See, Caesar! O, behold,</LINE>
<LINE>How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;</LINE>
<LINE>And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.</LINE>
<LINE>The ingratitude of this Seleucus does</LINE>
<LINE>Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust</LINE>
<LINE>Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt</LINE>
<LINE>Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!</LINE>
<LINE>O rarely base!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good queen, let us entreat you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,</LINE>
<LINE>Doing the honour of thy lordliness</LINE>
<LINE>To one so meek, that mine own servant should</LINE>
<LINE>Parcel the sum of my disgraces by</LINE>
<LINE>Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>That I some lady trifles have reserved,</LINE>
<LINE>Immoment toys, things of such dignity</LINE>
<LINE>As we greet modern friends withal; and say,</LINE>
<LINE>Some nobler token I have kept apart</LINE>
<LINE>For Livia and Octavia, to induce</LINE>
<LINE>Their mediation; must I be unfolded</LINE>
<LINE>With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me</LINE>
<LINE>Beneath the fall I have.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To SELEUCUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Prithee, go hence;</LINE>
<LINE>Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits</LINE>
<LINE>Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wouldst have mercy on me.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought</LINE>
<LINE>For things that others do; and, when we fall,</LINE>
<LINE>We answer others' merits in our name,</LINE>
<LINE>Are therefore to be pitied.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cleopatra,</LINE>
<LINE>Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,</LINE>
<LINE>Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,</LINE>
<LINE>Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,</LINE>
<LINE>Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you</LINE>
<LINE>Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;</LINE>
<LINE>Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;</LINE>
<LINE>For we intend so to dispose you as</LINE>
<LINE>Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:</LINE>
<LINE>Our care and pity is so much upon you,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>IRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,</LINE>

<LINE>Madam, I will.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOLABELLA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,</LINE>
<LINE>Which my love makes religion to obey,</LINE>
<LINE>I tell you this: Caesar through Syria</LINE>
<LINE>Intends his journey; and within three days</LINE>
<LINE>You with your children will he send before:</LINE>
<LINE>Make your best use of this: I have perform'd</LINE>
<LINE>Your pleasure and my promise.</LINE>

<LINE>Dolabella,</LINE>
<LINE>I shall remain your debtor.</LINE>

<LINE>I your servant,</LINE>
<LINE>Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Caesar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, and thanks.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit DOLABELLA</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now, Iras, what think'st thou?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown</LINE>
<LINE>In Rome, as well as I mechanic slaves</LINE>
<LINE>With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall</LINE>
<LINE>Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,</LINE>
<LINE>Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,</LINE>
<LINE>And forced to drink their vapour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The gods forbid!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors</LINE>
<LINE>Will catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymers</LINE>
<LINE>Ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians</LINE>
<LINE>Extemporally will stage us, and present</LINE>
<LINE>Our Alexandrian revels; Antony</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see</LINE>
<LINE>Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness</LINE>
<LINE>I' the posture of a whore.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O the good gods!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, that's certain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IRAS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll never see 't; for, I am sure, my nails</LINE>
<LINE>Are stronger than mine eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, that's the way</LINE>
<LINE>To fool their preparation, and to conquer</LINE>
<LINE>Their most absurd intents.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter CHARMIAN</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now, Charmian!</LINE>
<LINE>Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch</LINE>
<LINE>My best attires: I am again for Cydnus,</LINE>
<LINE>To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;</LINE>
<LINE>And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave</LINE>
<LINE>To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.</LINE>
<LINE>Wherefore's this noise?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit IRAS. A noise within</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter a Guardsman</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Guard</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is a rural fellow</LINE>
<LINE>That will not be denied your highness presence:</LINE>
<LINE>He brings you figs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let him come in.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Guardsman</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What poor an instrument</LINE>
<LINE>May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.</LINE>
<LINE>My resolution's placed, and I have nothing</LINE>
<LINE>Of woman in me: now from head to foot</LINE>
<LINE>I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon</LINE>
<LINE>No planet is of mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter Guardsman, with Clown bringing in a basket</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Guard</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Avoid, and leave him.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Guardsman</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,</LINE>
<LINE>That kills and pains not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party</LINE>
<LINE>that should desire you to touch him, for his biting</LINE>
<LINE>is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or</LINE>
<LINE>never recover.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Rememberest thou any that have died on't?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of</LINE>
<LINE>them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,</LINE>
<LINE>but something given to lie; as a woman should not</LINE>
<LINE>do, but in the way of honesty: how she died of the</LINE>
<LINE>biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes</LINE>
<LINE>a very good report o' the worm; but he that will</LINE>
<LINE>believe all that they say, shall never be saved by</LINE>
<LINE>half that they do: but this is most fallible, the</LINE>
<LINE>worm's an odd worm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Get thee hence; farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wish you all joy of the worm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Setting down his basket</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must think this, look you, that the worm will</LINE>
<LINE>do his kind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, ay; farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the</LINE>
<LINE>keeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is no</LINE>
<LINE>goodness in worm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is</LINE>
<LINE>not worth the feeding.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will it eat me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must not think I am so simple but I know the</LINE>
<LINE>devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a</LINE>
<LINE>woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her</LINE>
<LINE>not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the</LINE>
<LINE>gods great harm in their women; for in every ten</LINE>
<LINE>that they make, the devils mar five.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, get thee gone; farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter IRAS with a robe, crown, c</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have</LINE>
<LINE>Immortal longings in me: now no more</LINE>
<LINE>The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:</LINE>
<LINE>Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear</LINE>
<LINE>Antony call; I see him rouse himself</LINE>
<LINE>To praise my noble act; I hear him mock</LINE>
<LINE>The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men</LINE>
<LINE>To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:</LINE>
<LINE>Now to that name my courage prove my title!</LINE>
<LINE>I am fire and air; my other elements</LINE>
<LINE>I give to baser life. So; have you done?</LINE>
<LINE>Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?</LINE>
<LINE>If thou and nature can so gently part,</LINE>
<LINE>The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,</LINE>
<LINE>Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?</LINE>
<LINE>If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world</LINE>
<LINE>It is not worth leave-taking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,</LINE>
<LINE>The gods themselves do weep!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This proves me base:</LINE>
<LINE>If she first meet the curled Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss</LINE>
<LINE>Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou</LINE>
<LINE>mortal wretch,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To an asp, which she applies to her breast</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate</LINE>
<LINE>Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool</LINE>
<LINE>Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,</LINE>
<LINE>That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass</LINE>
<LINE>Unpolicied!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O eastern star!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, peace!</LINE>
<LINE>Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,</LINE>
<LINE>That sucks the nurse asleep?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, break! O, break!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,--</LINE>
<LINE>O Antony!--Nay, I will take thee too.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Applying another asp to her arm</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What should I stay--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Dies</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In this vile world? So, fare thee well.</LINE>
<LINE>Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies</LINE>
<LINE>A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;</LINE>
<LINE>And golden Phoebus never be beheld</LINE>
<LINE>Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll mend it, and then play.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the Guard, rushing in</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Guard</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is the queen?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak softly, wake her not.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Guard</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Caesar hath sent--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Too slow a messenger.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Applies an asp</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Guard</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Guard</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Guard</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARMIAN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is well done, and fitting for a princess</LINE>
<LINE>Descended of so many royal kings.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, soldier!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Dies</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter DOLABELLA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOLABELLA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How goes it here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Guard</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOLABELLA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Caesar, thy thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming</LINE>
<LINE>To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou</LINE>
<LINE>So sought'st to hinder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Within  'A way there, a way for Caesar!'</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and all his train marching</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOLABELLA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O sir, you are too sure an augurer;</LINE>
<LINE>That you did fear is done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bravest at the last,</LINE>
<LINE>She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,</LINE>
<LINE>Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?</LINE>
<LINE>I do not see them bleed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOLABELLA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who was last with them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Guard</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A simple countryman, that brought her figs:</LINE>
<LINE>This was his basket.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Poison'd, then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Guard</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake:</LINE>
<LINE>I found her trimming up the diadem</LINE>
<LINE>On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood</LINE>
<LINE>And on the sudden dropp'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O noble weakness!</LINE>
<LINE>If they had swallow'd poison, 'twould appear</LINE>
<LINE>By external swelling: but she looks like sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>As she would catch another Antony</LINE>
<LINE>In her strong toil of grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOLABELLA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, on her breast,</LINE>
<LINE>There is a vent of blood and something blown:</LINE>
<LINE>The like is on her arm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Guard</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves</LINE>
<LINE>Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the caves of Nile.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most probable</LINE>
<LINE>That so she died; for her physician tells me</LINE>
<LINE>She hath pursued conclusions infinite</LINE>
<LINE>Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;</LINE>
<LINE>And bear her women from the monument:</LINE>
<LINE>She shall be buried by her Antony:</LINE>
<LINE>No grave upon the earth shall clip in it</LINE>
<LINE>A pair so famous. High events as these</LINE>
<LINE>Strike those that make them; and their story is</LINE>
<LINE>No less in pity than his glory which</LINE>
<LINE>Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall</LINE>
<LINE>In solemn show attend this funeral;</LINE>
<LINE>And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see</LINE>
<LINE>High order in this great solemnity.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA,
and LAFEU, all in black</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death</LINE>
<LINE>anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to</LINE>
<LINE>whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,</LINE>
<LINE>sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times</LINE>
<LINE>good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose</LINE>
<LINE>worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather</LINE>
<LINE>than lack it where there is such abundance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose</LINE>
<LINE>practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and</LINE>
<LINE>finds no other advantage in the process but only the</LINE>
<LINE>losing of hope by time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that</LINE>
<LINE>'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was</LINE>
<LINE>almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so</LINE>
<LINE>far, would have made nature immortal, and death</LINE>
<LINE>should have play for lack of work. Would, for the</LINE>
<LINE>king's sake, he were living! I think it would be</LINE>
<LINE>the death of the king's disease.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How called you the man you speak of, madam?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was</LINE>
<LINE>his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very</LINE>
<LINE>lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he</LINE>
<LINE>was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge</LINE>
<LINE>could be set up against mortality.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A fistula, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I heard not of it before.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman</LINE>
<LINE>the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my</LINE>
<LINE>overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that</LINE>
<LINE>her education promises; her dispositions she</LINE>
<LINE>inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where</LINE>
<LINE>an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there</LINE>
<LINE>commendations go with pity; they are virtues and</LINE>
<LINE>traitors too; in her they are the better for their</LINE>
<LINE>simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise</LINE>
<LINE>in. The remembrance of her father never approaches</LINE>
<LINE>her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all</LINE>
<LINE>livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;</LINE>
<LINE>go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect</LINE>
<LINE>a sorrow than have it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,</LINE>
<LINE>excessive grief the enemy to the living.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess</LINE>
<LINE>makes it soon mortal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, I desire your holy wishes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How understand we that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father</LINE>
<LINE>In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue</LINE>
<LINE>Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness</LINE>
<LINE>Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,</LINE>
<LINE>Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy</LINE>
<LINE>Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend</LINE>
<LINE>Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, were that all! I think not on my father;</LINE>
<LINE>And these great tears grace his remembrance more</LINE>
<LINE>Than those I shed for him. What was he like?</LINE>
<LINE>I have forgot him: my imagination</LINE>
<LINE>Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.</LINE>
<LINE>I am undone: there is no living, none,</LINE>
<LINE>If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one</LINE>
<LINE>That I should love a bright particular star</LINE>
<LINE>And think to wed it, he is so above me:</LINE>
<LINE>In his bright radiance and collateral light</LINE>
<LINE>Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.</LINE>
<LINE>The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:</LINE>
<LINE>The hind that would be mated by the lion</LINE>
<LINE>Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,</LINE>
<LINE>To see him every hour; to sit and draw</LINE>
<LINE>His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,</LINE>
<LINE>In our heart's table; heart too capable</LINE>
<LINE>Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:</LINE>
<LINE>But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy</LINE>
<LINE>Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter PAROLLES</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet I know him a notorious liar,</LINE>
<LINE>Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,</LINE>
<LINE>That they take place, when virtue's steely bones</LINE>
<LINE>Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see</LINE>
<LINE>Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Save you, fair queen!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And you, monarch!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you meditating on virginity?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me</LINE>
<LINE>ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how</LINE>
<LINE>may we barricado it against him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Keep him out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,</LINE>
<LINE>in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some</LINE>
<LINE>warlike resistance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is none: man, sitting down before you, will</LINE>
<LINE>undermine you and blow you up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bless our poor virginity from underminers and</LINE>
<LINE>blowers up! Is there no military policy, how</LINE>
<LINE>virgins might blow up men?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be</LINE>
<LINE>blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with</LINE>
<LINE>the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It</LINE>
<LINE>is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to</LINE>
<LINE>preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational</LINE>
<LINE>increase and there was never virgin got till</LINE>
<LINE>virginity was first lost. That you were made of is</LINE>
<LINE>metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost</LINE>
<LINE>may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is</LINE>
<LINE>ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the</LINE>
<LINE>rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,</LINE>
<LINE>is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible</LINE>
<LINE>disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:</LINE>
<LINE>virginity murders itself and should be buried in</LINE>
<LINE>highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate</LINE>
<LINE>offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,</LINE>
<LINE>much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very</LINE>
<LINE>paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.</LINE>
<LINE>Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of</LINE>
<LINE>self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the</LINE>
<LINE>canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose</LINE>
<LINE>by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make</LINE>
<LINE>itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the</LINE>
<LINE>principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it</LINE>
<LINE>likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with</LINE>
<LINE>lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't</LINE>
<LINE>while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.</LINE>
<LINE>Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out</LINE>
<LINE>of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just</LINE>
<LINE>like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not</LINE>
<LINE>now. Your date is better in your pie and your</LINE>
<LINE>porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,</LINE>
<LINE>your old virginity, is like one of our French</LINE>
<LINE>withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,</LINE>
<LINE>'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;</LINE>
<LINE>marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not my virginity yet</LINE>
<LINE>There shall your master have a thousand loves,</LINE>
<LINE>A mother and a mistress and a friend,</LINE>
<LINE>A phoenix, captain and an enemy,</LINE>
<LINE>A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,</LINE>
<LINE>A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;</LINE>
<LINE>His humble ambition, proud humility,</LINE>
<LINE>His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,</LINE>
<LINE>His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world</LINE>
<LINE>Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,</LINE>
<LINE>That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--</LINE>
<LINE>I know not what he shall. God send him well!</LINE>
<LINE>The court's a learning place, and he is one--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What one, i' faith?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That I wish well. 'Tis pity--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's pity?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That wishing well had not a body in't,</LINE>
<LINE>Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,</LINE>
<LINE>Might with effects of them follow our friends,</LINE>
<LINE>And show what we alone must think, which never</LINE>
<LINE>Return us thanks.</LINE>

<LINE>Why think you so?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You go so much backward when you fight.</LINE>

<LINE>That's for advantage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;</LINE>
<LINE>but the composition that your valour and fear makes</LINE>
<LINE>in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee</LINE>
<LINE>acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the</LINE>

<LINE>thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's</LINE>
<LINE>counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon</LINE>
<LINE>thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and</LINE>
<LINE>thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When</LINE>
<LINE>thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast</LINE>

<LINE>Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it</LINE>
<LINE>A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Young Bertram.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;</LINE>
<LINE>Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts</LINE>
<LINE>Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My thanks and duty are your majesty's.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would I had that corporal soundness now,</LINE>
<LINE>As when thy father and myself in friendship</LINE>
<LINE>First tried our soldiership! He did look far</LINE>
<LINE>Into the service of the time and was</LINE>
<LINE>Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;</LINE>
<LINE>But on us both did haggish age steal on</LINE>
<LINE>And wore us out of act. It much repairs me</LINE>
<LINE>To talk of your good father. In his youth</LINE>
<LINE>He had the wit which I can well observe</LINE>
<LINE>To-day in our young lords; but they may jest</LINE>
<LINE>Till their own scorn return to them unnoted</LINE>
<LINE>Ere they can hide their levity in honour;</LINE>
<LINE>So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness</LINE>
<LINE>Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,</LINE>
<LINE>His equal had awaked them, and his honour,</LINE>
<LINE>Clock to itself, knew the true minute when</LINE>
<LINE>Exception bid him speak, and at this time</LINE>
<LINE>His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him</LINE>
<LINE>He used as creatures of another place</LINE>
<LINE>And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,</LINE>
<LINE>Making them proud of his humility,</LINE>
<LINE>In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man</LINE>
<LINE>Might be a copy to these younger times;</LINE>
<LINE>Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now</LINE>
<LINE>But goers backward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His good remembrance, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;</LINE>
<LINE>So in approof lives not his epitaph</LINE>
<LINE>As in your royal speech.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would I were with him! He would always say--</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words</LINE>
<LINE>He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,</LINE>
<LINE>To grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--</LINE>
<LINE>This his good melancholy oft began,</LINE>
<LINE>On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,</LINE>
<LINE>When it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,</LINE>
<LINE>'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff</LINE>
<LINE>Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses</LINE>
<LINE>All but new things disdain; whose judgments are</LINE>
<LINE>Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies</LINE>
<LINE>Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;</LINE>
<LINE>I after him do after him wish too,</LINE>
<LINE>Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,</LINE>
<LINE>I quickly were dissolved from my hive,</LINE>
<LINE>To give some labourers room.</LINE>

<LINE>What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:</LINE>
<LINE>the complaints I have heard of you I do not all</LINE>

<LINE>He that ears my land spares my team and gives me</LINE>

<LINE>of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh</LINE>
<LINE>and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my</LINE>
<LINE>flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses</LINE>
<LINE>my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to</LINE>

<LINE>going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Steward</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and</LINE>
<LINE>she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully</LINE>
<LINE>make title to as much love as she finds: there is</LINE>
<LINE>more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid</LINE>
<LINE>her than she'll demand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Steward</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, I was very late more near her than I think</LINE>
<LINE>she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate</LINE>
<LINE>to herself her own words to her own ears; she</LINE>
<LINE>thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any</LINE>
<LINE>stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son:</LINE>
<LINE>Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put</LINE>
<LINE>such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no</LINE>
<LINE>god, that would not extend his might, only where</LINE>
<LINE>qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that</LINE>
<LINE>would suffer her poor knight surprised, without</LINE>
<LINE>rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.</LINE>
<LINE>This she delivered in the most bitter touch of</LINE>
<LINE>sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I</LINE>
<LINE>held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;</LINE>
<LINE>sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns</LINE>
<LINE>you something to know it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have discharged this honestly; keep it to</LINE>
<LINE>yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this</LINE>
<LINE>before, which hung so tottering in the balance that</LINE>
<LINE>I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,</LINE>
<LINE>leave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank you</LINE>
<LINE>for your honest care: I will speak with you further anon.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Steward</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter HELENA</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Even so it was with me when I was young:</LINE>
<LINE>If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn</LINE>
<LINE>Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;</LINE>
<LINE>Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;</LINE>
<LINE>It is the show and seal of nature's truth,</LINE>
<LINE>Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth:</LINE>
<LINE>By our remembrances of days foregone,</LINE>
<LINE>Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.</LINE>
<LINE>Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is your pleasure, madam?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You know, Helen,</LINE>
<LINE>I am a mother to you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mine honourable mistress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, a mother:</LINE>
<LINE>Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'</LINE>
<LINE>Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother,'</LINE>
<LINE>That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;</LINE>
<LINE>And put you in the catalogue of those</LINE>
<LINE>That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen</LINE>
<LINE>Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds</LINE>
<LINE>A native slip to us from foreign seeds:</LINE>
<LINE>You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet I express to you a mother's care:</LINE>
<LINE>God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood</LINE>
<LINE>To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,</LINE>
<LINE>That this distemper'd messenger of wet,</LINE>
<LINE>The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?</LINE>
<LINE>Why? that you are my daughter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That I am not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say, I am your mother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon, madam;</LINE>
<LINE>The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:</LINE>
<LINE>I am from humble, he from honour'd name;</LINE>
<LINE>No note upon my parents, his all noble:</LINE>
<LINE>My master, my dear lord he is; and I</LINE>
<LINE>His servant live, and will his vassal die:</LINE>
<LINE>He must not be my brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor I your mother?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are my mother, madam; would you were,--</LINE>
<LINE>So that my lord your son were not my brother,--</LINE>
<LINE>Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,</LINE>
<LINE>I care no more for than I do for heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>So I were not his sister. Can't no other,</LINE>
<LINE>But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:</LINE>
<LINE>God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother</LINE>
<LINE>So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?</LINE>
<LINE>My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I see</LINE>
<LINE>The mystery of your loneliness, and find</LINE>
<LINE>Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross</LINE>
<LINE>You love my son; invention is ashamed,</LINE>
<LINE>Against the proclamation of thy passion,</LINE>
<LINE>To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;</LINE>
<LINE>But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks</LINE>
<LINE>Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes</LINE>
<LINE>See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors</LINE>
<LINE>That in their kind they speak it: only sin</LINE>
<LINE>And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?</LINE>
<LINE>If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;</LINE>
<LINE>If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee,</LINE>
<LINE>As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me truly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good madam, pardon me!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you love my son?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your pardon, noble mistress!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Love you my son?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not you love him, madam?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go not about; my love hath in't a bond,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose</LINE>
<LINE>The state of your affection; for your passions</LINE>
<LINE>Have to the full appeach'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, I confess,</LINE>
<LINE>Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,</LINE>
<LINE>That before you, and next unto high heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>I love your son.</LINE>
<LINE>My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:</LINE>
<LINE>Be not offended; for it hurts not him</LINE>
<LINE>That he is loved of me: I follow him not</LINE>
<LINE>By any token of presumptuous suit;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet never know how that desert should be.</LINE>
<LINE>I know I love in vain, strive against hope;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet in this captious and intenible sieve</LINE>
<LINE>I still pour in the waters of my love</LINE>
<LINE>And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,</LINE>
<LINE>Religious in mine error, I adore</LINE>
<LINE>The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,</LINE>
<LINE>But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,</LINE>
<LINE>Let not your hate encounter with my love</LINE>
<LINE>For loving where you do: but if yourself,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,</LINE>
<LINE>Did ever in so true a flame of liking</LINE>
<LINE>Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian</LINE>
<LINE>Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity</LINE>
<LINE>To her, whose state is such that cannot choose</LINE>
<LINE>But lend and give where she is sure to lose;</LINE>
<LINE>That seeks not to find that her search implies,</LINE>
<LINE>But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Had you not lately an intent,--speak truly,--</LINE>
<LINE>To go to Paris?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, I had.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherefore? tell true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.</LINE>
<LINE>You know my father left me some prescriptions</LINE>
<LINE>Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading</LINE>
<LINE>And manifest experience had collected</LINE>
<LINE>For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me</LINE>
<LINE>In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,</LINE>
<LINE>As notes whose faculties inclusive were</LINE>
<LINE>More than they were in note: amongst the rest,</LINE>
<LINE>There is a remedy, approved, set down,</LINE>
<LINE>To cure the desperate languishings whereof</LINE>
<LINE>The king is render'd lost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This was your motive</LINE>
<LINE>For Paris, was it? speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord your son made me to think of this;</LINE>
<LINE>Else Paris and the medicine and the king</LINE>
<LINE>Had from the conversation of my thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>Haply been absent then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But think you, Helen,</LINE>
<LINE>If you should tender your supposed aid,</LINE>
<LINE>He would receive it? he and his physicians</LINE>
<LINE>Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,</LINE>
<LINE>They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit</LINE>
<LINE>A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,</LINE>
<LINE>Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off</LINE>
<LINE>The danger to itself?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's something in't,</LINE>
<LINE>More than my father's skill, which was the greatest</LINE>
<LINE>Of his profession, that his good receipt</LINE>
<LINE>Shall for my legacy be sanctified</LINE>
<LINE>By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour</LINE>
<LINE>But give me leave to try success, I'ld venture</LINE>
<LINE>The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure</LINE>
<LINE>By such a day and hour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dost thou believe't?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, madam, knowingly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,</LINE>
<LINE>Means and attendants and my loving greetings</LINE>
<LINE>To those of mine in court: I'll stay at home</LINE>
<LINE>And pray God's blessing into thy attempt:</LINE>
<LINE>Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,</LINE>
<LINE>What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles</LINE>
<LINE>Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell:</LINE>
<LINE>Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all</LINE>
<LINE>The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart</LINE>
<LINE>Will not confess he owes the malady</LINE>
<LINE>That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;</LINE>
<LINE>Whether I live or die, be you the sons</LINE>
<LINE>Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy,--</LINE>
<LINE>Those bated that inherit but the fall</LINE>
<LINE>Of the last monarchy,--see that you come</LINE>
<LINE>Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when</LINE>
<LINE>The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,</LINE>

<LINE>Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To BERTRAM</STAGEDIR>  Use a more spacious ceremony to the</LINE>
<LINE>noble lords; you have restrained yourself within the</LINE>
<LINE>list of too cold an adieu: be more expressive to</LINE>
<LINE>them: for they wear themselves in the cap of the</LINE>
<LINE>time, there do muster true gait, eat, speak, and</LINE>
<LINE>move under the influence of the most received star;</LINE>
<LINE>and though the devil lead the measure, such are to</LINE>

<LINE><STAGEDIR>Kneeling</STAGEDIR>  Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll fee thee to stand up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then here's a man stands, that has brought his pardon.</LINE>
<LINE>I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy,</LINE>
<LINE>And that at my bidding you could so stand up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,</LINE>
<LINE>And ask'd thee mercy for't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good faith, across: but, my good lord 'tis thus;</LINE>
<LINE>Will you be cured of your infirmity?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?</LINE>
<LINE>Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if</LINE>
<LINE>My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine</LINE>
<LINE>That's able to breathe life into a stone,</LINE>
<LINE>Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary</LINE>
<LINE>With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,</LINE>
<LINE>Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,</LINE>
<LINE>To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand,</LINE>
<LINE>And write to her a love-line.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What 'her' is this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Doctor She: my lord, there's one arrived,</LINE>
<LINE>If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour,</LINE>
<LINE>If seriously I may convey my thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>In this my light deliverance, I have spoke</LINE>
<LINE>With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,</LINE>
<LINE>Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more</LINE>
<LINE>Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her</LINE>
<LINE>For that is her demand, and know her business?</LINE>
<LINE>That done, laugh well at me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, good Lafeu,</LINE>
<LINE>Bring in the admiration; that we with thee</LINE>
<LINE>May spend our wonder too, or take off thine</LINE>
<LINE>By wondering how thou took'st it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I'll fit you,</LINE>
<LINE>And not be all day neither.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, come your ways.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This haste hath wings indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, come your ways:</LINE>
<LINE>This is his majesty; say your mind to him:</LINE>
<LINE>A traitor you do look like; but such traitors</LINE>
<LINE>His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressid's uncle,</LINE>
<LINE>That dare leave two together; fare you well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, fair one, does your business follow us?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my good lord.</LINE>
<LINE>Gerard de Narbon was my father;</LINE>
<LINE>In what he did profess, well found.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I knew him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The rather will I spare my praises towards him:</LINE>
<LINE>Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death</LINE>
<LINE>Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.</LINE>
<LINE>Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,</LINE>
<LINE>And of his old experience the oily darling,</LINE>
<LINE>He bade me store up, as a triple eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;</LINE>
<LINE>And hearing your high majesty is touch'd</LINE>
<LINE>With that malignant cause wherein the honour</LINE>
<LINE>Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,</LINE>
<LINE>I come to tender it and my appliance</LINE>
<LINE>With all bound humbleness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We thank you, maiden;</LINE>
<LINE>But may not be so credulous of cure,</LINE>
<LINE>When our most learned doctors leave us and</LINE>
<LINE>The congregated college have concluded</LINE>
<LINE>That labouring art can never ransom nature</LINE>
<LINE>From her inaidible estate; I say we must not</LINE>
<LINE>So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,</LINE>
<LINE>To prostitute our past-cure malady</LINE>
<LINE>To empirics, or to dissever so</LINE>
<LINE>Our great self and our credit, to esteem</LINE>
<LINE>A senseless help when help past sense we deem.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My duty then shall pay me for my pains:</LINE>
<LINE>I will no more enforce mine office on you.</LINE>
<LINE>Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>A modest one, to bear me back a again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give</LINE>
<LINE>As one near death to those that wish him live:</LINE>
<LINE>But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,</LINE>
<LINE>I knowing all my peril, thou no art.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What I can do can do no hurt to try,</LINE>
<LINE>Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.</LINE>
<LINE>He that of greatest works is finisher</LINE>
<LINE>Oft does them by the weakest minister:</LINE>
<LINE>So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,</LINE>
<LINE>When judges have been babes; great floods have flown</LINE>
<LINE>From simple sources, and great seas have dried</LINE>
<LINE>When miracles have by the greatest been denied.</LINE>
<LINE>Oft expectation fails and most oft there</LINE>
<LINE>Where most it promises, and oft it hits</LINE>
<LINE>Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:</LINE>
<LINE>Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd:</LINE>
<LINE>It is not so with Him that all things knows</LINE>
<LINE>As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;</LINE>
<LINE>But most it is presumption in us when</LINE>
<LINE>The help of heaven we count the act of men.</LINE>
<LINE>Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;</LINE>

<LINE>Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tax of impudence,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak</LINE>
<LINE>His powerful sound within an organ weak:</LINE>
<LINE>And what impossibility would slay</LINE>
<LINE>In common sense, sense saves another way.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate</LINE>

<LINE>Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all</LINE>
<LINE>That happiness and prime can happy call:</LINE>

<LINE>Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,</LINE>
<LINE>That ministers thine own death if I die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I break time, or flinch in property</LINE>
<LINE>Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,</LINE>

<LINE>But, if I help, what do you promise me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand</LINE>

<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of</LINE>
<LINE>your breeding.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: I</LINE>
<LINE>know my business is but to the court.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To the court! why, what place make you special,</LINE>
<LINE>when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he</LINE>
<LINE>may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make</LINE>
<LINE>a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand and say nothing,</LINE>
<LINE>has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed</LINE>
<LINE>such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the</LINE>
<LINE>court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all</LINE>
<LINE>men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all</LINE>
<LINE>questions.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks,</LINE>
<LINE>the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn</LINE>
<LINE>buttock, or any buttock.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will your answer serve fit to all questions?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,</LINE>
<LINE>as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib's</LINE>
<LINE>rush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove</LINE>
<LINE>Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his</LINE>
<LINE>hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen</LINE>
<LINE>to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the</LINE>
<LINE>friar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all</LINE>
<LINE>questions?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From below your duke to beneath your constable, it</LINE>
<LINE>will fit any question.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It must be an answer of most monstrous size that</LINE>
<LINE>must fit all demands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned</LINE>
<LINE>should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that</LINE>

<LINE>do you no harm to learn.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in</LINE>

<LINE>pray you, sir, are you a courtier?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off. More,</LINE>
<LINE>more, a hundred of them.</LINE>

<LINE>Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.</LINE>

<LINE>O Lord, sir! spare not me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you cry, 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and</LINE>
<LINE>'spare not me?' Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very</LINE>

<LINE>to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They say miracles are past; and we have our</LINE>
<LINE>philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar,</LINE>
<LINE>things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that</LINE>
<LINE>we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves</LINE>
<LINE>into seeming knowledge, when we should submit</LINE>
<LINE>ourselves to an unknown fear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath</LINE>
<LINE>shot out in our latter times.</LINE>

<LINE>And so 'tis.</LINE>

<LINE>Of all the learned and authentic fellows,--</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Right; so I say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing, you</LINE>
<LINE>shall read it in--what do you call there?</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange, that is the</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In a most weak--</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>pausing</STAGEDIR>

<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest,</LINE>

<LINE>Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,</LINE>
<LINE>And to imperial Love, that god most high,</LINE>
<LINE>Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And grant it.</LINE>

<LINE>Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be not afraid that I your hand should take;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll never do you wrong for your own sake:</LINE>

<LINE>These boys are boys of ice, they'll none have her:</LINE>
<LINE>sure, they are bastards to the English; the French</LINE>
<LINE>ne'er got 'em.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are too young, too happy, and too good,</LINE>
<LINE>To make yourself a son out of my blood.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Fourth Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fair one, I think not so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk</LINE>
<LINE>wine: but if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth</LINE>
<LINE>of fourteen; I have known thee already.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To BERTRAM</STAGEDIR>  I dare not say I take you; but I give</LINE>
<LINE>Me and my service, ever whilst I live,</LINE>
<LINE>Into your guiding power. This is the man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,</LINE>
<LINE>In such a business give me leave to use</LINE>
<LINE>The help of mine own eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know'st thou not, Bertram,</LINE>
<LINE>What she has done for me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, my good lord;</LINE>
<LINE>But never hope to know why I should marry her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But follows it, my lord, to bring me down</LINE>
<LINE>Must answer for your raising? I know her well:</LINE>
<LINE>She had her breeding at my father's charge.</LINE>
<LINE>A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain</LINE>
<LINE>Rather corrupt me ever!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which</LINE>
<LINE>I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,</LINE>
<LINE>Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,</LINE>
<LINE>Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off</LINE>
<LINE>In differences so mighty. If she be</LINE>
<LINE>All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,</LINE>
<LINE>A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest</LINE>
<LINE>Of virtue for the name: but do not so:</LINE>
<LINE>From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,</LINE>
<LINE>The place is dignified by the doer's deed:</LINE>
<LINE>Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,</LINE>
<LINE>It is a dropsied honour. Good alone</LINE>
<LINE>Is good without a name. Vileness is so:</LINE>
<LINE>The property by what it is should go,</LINE>
<LINE>Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;</LINE>
<LINE>In these to nature she's immediate heir,</LINE>
<LINE>And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,</LINE>
<LINE>Which challenges itself as honour's born</LINE>
<LINE>And is not like the sire: honours thrive,</LINE>
<LINE>When rather from our acts we them derive</LINE>
<LINE>Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave</LINE>
<LINE>Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave</LINE>
<LINE>A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb</LINE>
<LINE>Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb</LINE>
<LINE>Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?</LINE>
<LINE>If thou canst like this creature as a maid,</LINE>
<LINE>I can create the rest: virtue and she</LINE>
<LINE>Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad:</LINE>
<LINE>Let the rest go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,</LINE>
<LINE>I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;</LINE>
<LINE>That dost in vile misprision shackle up</LINE>
<LINE>My love and her desert; that canst not dream,</LINE>
<LINE>We, poising us in her defective scale,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,</LINE>
<LINE>It is in us to plant thine honour where</LINE>
<LINE>We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:</LINE>
<LINE>Obey our will, which travails in thy good:</LINE>
<LINE>Believe not thy disdain, but presently</LINE>
<LINE>Do thine own fortunes that obedient right</LINE>
<LINE>Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;</LINE>
<LINE>Or I will throw thee from my care for ever</LINE>
<LINE>Into the staggers and the careless lapse</LINE>
<LINE>Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate</LINE>
<LINE>Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,</LINE>
<LINE>Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit</LINE>
<LINE>My fancy to your eyes: when I consider</LINE>
<LINE>What great creation and what dole of honour</LINE>
<LINE>Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late</LINE>
<LINE>Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now</LINE>
<LINE>The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,</LINE>
<LINE>Is as 'twere born so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take her by the hand,</LINE>
<LINE>And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise</LINE>
<LINE>A counterpoise, if not to thy estate</LINE>
<LINE>A balance more replete.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I take her hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good fortune and the favour of the king</LINE>
<LINE>Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay; is it not a language I speak?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>To any count, to all counts, to what is man.</LINE>

<LINE>What I dare too well do, I dare not do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty</LINE>
<LINE>wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy</LINE>
<LINE>travel; it might pass: yet the scarfs and the</LINE>
<LINE>bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from</LINE>
<LINE>believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen. I</LINE>
<LINE>have now found thee; when I lose thee again, I care</LINE>
<LINE>not: yet art thou good for nothing but taking up; and</LINE>
<LINE>that thou't scarce worth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou</LINE>
<LINE>hasten thy trial; which if--Lord have mercy on thee</LINE>
<LINE>for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare thee</LINE>
<LINE>well: thy casement I need not open, for I look</LINE>
<LINE>through thee. Give me thy hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not</LINE>
<LINE>bate thee a scruple.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I shall be wiser.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at</LINE>
<LINE>a smack o' the contrary. If ever thou be'st bound</LINE>
<LINE>in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is</LINE>
<LINE>to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold</LINE>
<LINE>my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge,</LINE>
<LINE>that I may say in the default, he is a man I know.</LINE>

<LINE>I'll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with</LINE>

<LINE>Ay, sir.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou</LINE>
<LINE>garter up thy arms o' this fashion? dost make hose of</LINE>
<LINE>sleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set</LINE>
<LINE>thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine</LINE>
<LINE>honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'ld beat</LINE>
<LINE>thee: methinks, thou art a general offence, and</LINE>
<LINE>every man should beat thee: I think thou wast</LINE>
<LINE>created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a</LINE>
<LINE>kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond and</LINE>
<LINE>no true traveller: you are more saucy with lords</LINE>
<LINE>and honourable personages than the commission of your</LINE>

<LINE>Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to the wars!</LINE>
<LINE>He wears his honour in a box unseen,</LINE>
<LINE>That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,</LINE>
<LINE>Spending his manly marrow in her arms,</LINE>
<LINE>Which should sustain the bound and high curvet</LINE>

<LINE>Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.</LINE>

<LINE>What two things?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them</LINE>
<LINE>on, have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So that you had her wrinkles and I her money,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, I say nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's</LINE>
<LINE>tongue shakes out his master's undoing: to say</LINE>
<LINE>nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have</LINE>
<LINE>nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which</LINE>
<LINE>is within a very little of nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away! thou'rt a knave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You should have said, sir, before a knave thou'rt a</LINE>
<LINE>knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.</LINE>
<LINE>Madam, my lord will go away to-night;</LINE>
<LINE>A very serious business calls on him.</LINE>
<LINE>The great prerogative and rite of love,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;</LINE>
<LINE>But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,</LINE>
<LINE>Which they distil now in the curbed time,</LINE>
<LINE>To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's his will else?</LINE>

<LINE>I have then sinned against his experience and</LINE>

<LINE>You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,</LINE>

<LINE>The ministration and required office</LINE>
<LINE>On my particular. Prepared I was not</LINE>

<LINE>So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you</LINE>
<LINE>That presently you take our way for home;</LINE>

<LINE>By self-unable motion: therefore dare not</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It hath happened all as I would have had it, save</LINE>
<LINE>that he comes not along with her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very</LINE>
<LINE>melancholy man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By what observance, I pray you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the</LINE>
<LINE>ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his</LINE>
<LINE>teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of</LINE>
<LINE>melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Opening a letter</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: our</LINE>
<LINE>old ling and our Isbels o' the country are nothing</LINE>
<LINE>like your old ling and your Isbels o' the court:</LINE>
<LINE>the brains of my Cupid's knocked out, and I begin to</LINE>
<LINE>love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What have we here?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>  I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hath</LINE>
<LINE>recovered the king, and undone me. I have wedded</LINE>
<LINE>her, not bedded her; and sworn to make the 'not'</LINE>
<LINE>eternal. You shall hear I am run away: know it</LINE>
<LINE>before the report come. If there be breadth enough</LINE>
<LINE>in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty</LINE>
<LINE>to you. Your unfortunate son,</LINE>
<LINE>BERTRAM.</LINE>
<LINE>This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.</LINE>
<LINE>To fly the favours of so good a king;</LINE>
<LINE>To pluck his indignation on thy head</LINE>
<LINE>By the misprising of a maid too virtuous</LINE>
<LINE>For the contempt of empire.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two</LINE>
<LINE>soldiers and my young lady!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some</LINE>
<LINE>comfort; your son will not be killed so soon as I</LINE>
<LINE>thought he would.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why should he be killed?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does:</LINE>
<LINE>the danger is in standing to't; that's the loss of</LINE>
<LINE>men, though it be the getting of children. Here</LINE>
<LINE>they come will tell you more: for my part, I only</LINE>
<LINE>hear your son was run away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Save you, good madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not say so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,</LINE>
<LINE>I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,</LINE>
<LINE>That the first face of neither, on the start,</LINE>
<LINE>Can woman me unto't: where is my son, I pray you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence:</LINE>
<LINE>We met him thitherward; for thence we came,</LINE>
<LINE>And, after some dispatch in hand at court,</LINE>
<LINE>Thither we bend again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look on his letter, madam; here's my passport.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which</LINE>
<LINE>never shall come off, and show me a child begotten</LINE>
<LINE>of thy body that I am father to, then call me</LINE>
<LINE>husband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.'</LINE>
<LINE>This is a dreadful sentence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Brought you this letter, gentlemen?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, madam;</LINE>
<LINE>And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;</LINE>
<LINE>If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou robb'st me of a moiety: he was my son;</LINE>
<LINE>But I do wash his name out of my blood,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And to be a soldier?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Such is his noble purpose; and believe 't,</LINE>
<LINE>The duke will lay upon him all the honour</LINE>
<LINE>That good convenience claims.</LINE>

<LINE>Return you thither?</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply, which his</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing in France, until he have no wife!</LINE>
<LINE>There's nothing here that is too good for him</LINE>
<LINE>But only she; and she deserves a lord</LINE>
<LINE>That twenty such rude boys might tend upon</LINE>
<LINE>And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A servant only, and a gentleman</LINE>
<LINE>Which I have sometime known.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Parolles, was it not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my good lady, he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.</LINE>
<LINE>My son corrupts a well-derived nature</LINE>
<LINE>With his inducement.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, good lady,</LINE>
<LINE>The fellow has a deal of that too much,</LINE>
<LINE>Which holds him much to have.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You're welcome, gentlemen.</LINE>
<LINE>I will entreat you, when you see my son,</LINE>
<LINE>To tell him that his sword can never win</LINE>
<LINE>The honour that he loses: more I'll entreat you</LINE>
<LINE>Written to bear along.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We serve you, madam,</LINE>
<LINE>In that and all your worthiest affairs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Not so, but as we change our courtesies.</LINE>
<LINE>Will you draw near!</LINE>

<LINE>'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing in France, until he has no wife!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;</LINE>
<LINE>Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I</LINE>
<LINE>That chase thee from thy country and expose</LINE>
<LINE>Those tender limbs of thine to the event</LINE>
<LINE>Of the none-sparing war? and is it I</LINE>
<LINE>That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou</LINE>
<LINE>Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark</LINE>
<LINE>Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,</LINE>
<LINE>That ride upon the violent speed of fire,</LINE>
<LINE>Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,</LINE>
<LINE>That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.</LINE>
<LINE>Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;</LINE>
<LINE>Whoever charges on his forward breast,</LINE>
<LINE>I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;</LINE>
<LINE>And, though I kill him not, I am the cause</LINE>
<LINE>His death was so effected: better 'twere</LINE>
<LINE>I met the ravin lion when he roar'd</LINE>
<LINE>With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere</LINE>
<LINE>That all the miseries which nature owes</LINE>
<LINE>Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,</LINE>
<LINE>Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,</LINE>
<LINE>As oft it loses all: I will be gone;</LINE>
<LINE>My being here it is that holds thee hence:</LINE>
<LINE>Shall I stay here to do't?  no, no, although</LINE>
<LINE>The air of paradise did fan the house</LINE>
<LINE>And angels officed all: I will be gone,</LINE>
<LINE>That pitiful rumour may report my flight,</LINE>
<LINE>To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Steward</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR></LINE>
<LINE>I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone:</LINE>
<LINE>Ambitious love hath so in me offended,</LINE>
<LINE>That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,</LINE>
<LINE>With sainted vow my faults to have amended.</LINE>
<LINE>Write, write, that from the bloody course of war</LINE>
<LINE>My dearest master, your dear son, may hie:</LINE>
<LINE>Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far</LINE>
<LINE>His name with zealous fervor sanctify:</LINE>
<LINE>His taken labours bid him me forgive;</LINE>
<LINE>I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth</LINE>
<LINE>From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,</LINE>
<LINE>Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth:</LINE>
<LINE>He is too good and fair for death and me:</LINE>
<LINE>Whom I myself embrace, to set him free.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!</LINE>
<LINE>Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much,</LINE>
<LINE>As letting her pass so: had I spoke with her,</LINE>
<LINE>I could have well diverted her intents,</LINE>
<LINE>Which thus she hath prevented.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Steward</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon me, madam:</LINE>
<LINE>If I had given you this at over-night,</LINE>
<LINE>She might have been o'erta'en; and yet she writes,</LINE>
<LINE>Pursuit would be but vain.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What angel shall</LINE>
<LINE>Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear</LINE>
<LINE>And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath</LINE>
<LINE>Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,</LINE>
<LINE>To this unworthy husband of his wife;</LINE>
<LINE>Let every word weigh heavy of her worth</LINE>
<LINE>That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief.</LINE>
<LINE>Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.</LINE>
<LINE>Dispatch the most convenient messenger:</LINE>
<LINE>When haply he shall hear that she is gone,</LINE>
<LINE>He will return; and hope I may that she,</LINE>
<LINE>Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,</LINE>
<LINE>Led hither by pure love: which of them both</LINE>
<LINE>Is dearest to me. I have no skill in sense</LINE>
<LINE>To make distinction: provide this messenger:</LINE>
<LINE>My heart is heavy and mine age is weak;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, come; for if they do approach the city, we</LINE>
<LINE>shall lose all the sight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They say the French count has done most honourable service.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is reported that he has taken their greatest</LINE>
<LINE>commander; and that with his own hand he slew the</LINE>
<LINE>duke's brother.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Tucket</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary</LINE>
<LINE>way: hark! you may know by their trumpets.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with</LINE>
<LINE>the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this</LINE>
<LINE>French earl: the honour of a maid is her name; and</LINE>
<LINE>no legacy is so rich as honesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited</LINE>
<LINE>by a gentleman his companion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a</LINE>
<LINE>filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the</LINE>
<LINE>young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises,</LINE>
<LINE>enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of</LINE>
<LINE>lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid</LINE>
<LINE>hath been seduced by them; and the misery is,</LINE>
<LINE>example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of</LINE>
<LINE>maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession,</LINE>
<LINE>but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten</LINE>
<LINE>them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but</LINE>
<LINE>I hope your own grace will keep you where you are,</LINE>
<LINE>though there were no further danger known but the</LINE>
<LINE>modesty which is so lost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall not need to fear me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hope so.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter HELENA, disguised like a Pilgrim</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Look, here comes a pilgrim: I know she will lie at</LINE>
<LINE>my house; thither they send one another: I'll</LINE>
<LINE>question her. God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To Saint Jaques le Grand.</LINE>
<LINE>Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At the Saint Francis here beside the port.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is this the way?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, marry, is't.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>A march afar</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Hark you! they come this way.</LINE>
<LINE>If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,</LINE>
<LINE>But till the troops come by,</LINE>
<LINE>I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;</LINE>
<LINE>The rather, for I think I know your hostess</LINE>
<LINE>As ample as myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it yourself?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you shall please so, pilgrim.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You came, I think, from France?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here you shall see a countryman of yours</LINE>
<LINE>That has done worthy service.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His name, I pray you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:</LINE>
<LINE>His face I know not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whatsome'er he is,</LINE>
<LINE>He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,</LINE>
<LINE>As 'tis reported, for the king had married him</LINE>
<LINE>Against his liking: think you it is so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is a gentleman that serves the count</LINE>
<LINE>Reports but coarsely of her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>What's his name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Monsieur Parolles.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, I believe with him,</LINE>
<LINE>In argument of praise, or to the worth</LINE>
<LINE>Of the great count himself, she is too mean</LINE>
<LINE>To have her name repeated: all her deserving</LINE>
<LINE>Is a reserved honesty, and that</LINE>
<LINE>I have not heard examined.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, poor lady!</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife</LINE>
<LINE>Of a detesting lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is,</LINE>
<LINE>Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her</LINE>
<LINE>A shrewd turn, if she pleased.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How do you mean?</LINE>
<LINE>May be the amorous count solicits her</LINE>
<LINE>In the unlawful purpose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He does indeed;</LINE>
<LINE>And brokes with all that can in such a suit</LINE>
<LINE>Corrupt the tender honour of a maid:</LINE>
<LINE>But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard</LINE>
<LINE>In honestest defence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE VI.  Camp before Florence.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter BERTRAM and the two French Lords</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his</LINE>
<LINE>way.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no</LINE>
<LINE>more in your respect.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>On my life, my lord, a bubble.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you think I am so far deceived in him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,</LINE>
<LINE>without any malice, but to speak of him as my</LINE>
<LINE>kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and</LINE>
<LINE>endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner</LINE>
<LINE>of no one good quality worthy your lordship's</LINE>
<LINE>entertainment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in</LINE>
<LINE>his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some</LINE>
<LINE>great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would I knew in what particular action to try him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>None better than to let him fetch off his drum,</LINE>
<LINE>which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly</LINE>
<LINE>surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he</LINE>
<LINE>knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink</LINE>
<LINE>him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he</LINE>
<LINE>is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when</LINE>
<LINE>we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship</LINE>
<LINE>present at his examination: if he do not, for the</LINE>
<LINE>promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of</LINE>
<LINE>base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the</LINE>
<LINE>intelligence in his power against you, and that with</LINE>
<LINE>the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never</LINE>
<LINE>trust my judgment in any thing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum;</LINE>
<LINE>he says he has a stratagem for't: when your</LINE>
<LINE>lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to</LINE>
<LINE>what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be</LINE>
<LINE>melted, if you give him not John Drum's</LINE>
<LINE>entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.</LINE>
<LINE>Here he comes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter PAROLLES</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to BERTRAM</STAGEDIR>  O, for the love of laughter,</LINE>
<LINE>hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch</LINE>
<LINE>off his drum in any hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your</LINE>
<LINE>disposition.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!</LINE>
<LINE>There was excellent command,--to charge in with our</LINE>
<LINE>horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That was not to be blamed in the command of the</LINE>
<LINE>service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar</LINE>
<LINE>himself could not have prevented, if he had been</LINE>
<LINE>there to command.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some</LINE>
<LINE>dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is</LINE>
<LINE>not to be recovered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It might have been recovered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It might; but it is not now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is to be recovered: but that the merit of</LINE>
<LINE>service is seldom attributed to the true and exact</LINE>
<LINE>performer, I would have that drum or another, or</LINE>
<LINE>'hic jacet.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you</LINE>
<LINE>think your mystery in stratagem can bring this</LINE>
<LINE>instrument of honour again into his native quarter,</LINE>
<LINE>be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will</LINE>
<LINE>grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you</LINE>
<LINE>speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.</LINE>
<LINE>and extend to you what further becomes his</LINE>
<LINE>greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your</LINE>
<LINE>worthiness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But you must not now slumber in it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll about it this evening: and I will presently</LINE>
<LINE>pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my</LINE>
<LINE>certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;</LINE>
<LINE>and by midnight look to hear further from me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not what the success will be, my lord; but</LINE>
<LINE>the attempt I vow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of</LINE>
<LINE>thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I love not many words.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a</LINE>
<LINE>strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems</LINE>
<LINE>to undertake this business, which he knows is not to</LINE>
<LINE>be done; damns himself to do and dares better be</LINE>
<LINE>damned than to do't?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it</LINE>
<LINE>is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and</LINE>
<LINE>for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but</LINE>
<LINE>when you find him out, you have him ever after.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of</LINE>
<LINE>this that so seriously he does address himself unto?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>None in the world; but return with an invention and</LINE>
<LINE>clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we</LINE>
<LINE>have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall</LINE>
<LINE>to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case</LINE>
<LINE>him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:</LINE>
<LINE>when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a</LINE>
<LINE>sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this</LINE>
<LINE>very night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your brother he shall go along with me.</LINE>

<LINE>Now will I lead you to the house, and show you</LINE>
<LINE>The lass I spoke of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But you say she's honest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once</LINE>
<LINE>And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,</LINE>
<LINE>By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Tokens and letters which she did re-send;</LINE>
<LINE>And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature:</LINE>
<LINE>Will you go see her?</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter HELENA and Widow</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you misdoubt me that I am not she,</LINE>
<LINE>I know not how I shall assure you further,</LINE>
<LINE>But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Though my estate be fallen, I was well born,</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing acquainted with these businesses;</LINE>
<LINE>And would not put my reputation now</LINE>
<LINE>In any staining act.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor would I wish you.</LINE>
<LINE>First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,</LINE>
<LINE>And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken</LINE>
<LINE>Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,</LINE>
<LINE>By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,</LINE>
<LINE>Err in bestowing it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I should believe you:</LINE>
<LINE>For you have show'd me that which well approves</LINE>
<LINE>You're great in fortune.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take this purse of gold,</LINE>
<LINE>And let me buy your friendly help thus far,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I will over-pay and pay again</LINE>
<LINE>When I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,</LINE>
<LINE>Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,</LINE>
<LINE>As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.</LINE>
<LINE>Now his important blood will nought deny</LINE>
<LINE>That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,</LINE>
<LINE>That downward hath succeeded in his house</LINE>
<LINE>From son to son, some four or five descents</LINE>
<LINE>Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds</LINE>
<LINE>In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,</LINE>
<LINE>To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,</LINE>
<LINE>Howe'er repented after.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now I see</LINE>
<LINE>The bottom of your purpose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You see it lawful, then: it is no more,</LINE>
<LINE>But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,</LINE>
<LINE>Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;</LINE>
<LINE>In fine, delivers me to fill the time,</LINE>
<LINE>Herself most chastely absent: after this,</LINE>
<LINE>To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns</LINE>
<LINE>To what is passed already.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have yielded:</LINE>
<LINE>Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,</LINE>
<LINE>That time and place with this deceit so lawful</LINE>
<LINE>May prove coherent. Every night he comes</LINE>
<LINE>With musics of all sorts and songs composed</LINE>
<LINE>To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us</LINE>
<LINE>To chide him from our eaves; for he persists</LINE>
<LINE>As if his life lay on't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then to-night</LINE>
<LINE>Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,</LINE>
<LINE>Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed</LINE>
<LINE>And lawful meaning in a lawful act,</LINE>
<LINE>Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:</LINE>
<LINE>But let's about it.</LINE>

Soldiers in ambush</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.</LINE>
<LINE>When you sally upon him, speak what terrible</LINE>
<LINE>language you will: though you understand it not</LINE>
<LINE>yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to</LINE>
<LINE>understand him, unless some one among us whom we</LINE>
<LINE>must produce for an interpreter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Soldier</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good captain, let me be the interpreter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>First Soldier</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sir, I warrant you.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Soldier</SPEAKER>
<LINE>E'en such as you speak to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He must think us some band of strangers i' the</LINE>
<LINE>adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of</LINE>
<LINE>all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every</LINE>
<LINE>one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we</LINE>
<LINE>speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to</LINE>
<LINE>know straight our purpose: choughs' language,</LINE>
<LINE>gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,</LINE>
<LINE>interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch,</LINE>
<LINE>ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>and then to return and swear the lies he forges.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter PAROLLES</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be</LINE>
<LINE>time enough to go home. What shall I say I have</LINE>
<LINE>done? It must be a very plausive invention that</LINE>
<LINE>carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces</LINE>
<LINE>have of late knocked too often at my door. I find</LINE>
<LINE>my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the</LINE>
<LINE>fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not</LINE>
<LINE>daring the reports of my tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What the devil should move me to undertake the</LINE>
<LINE>recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the</LINE>
<LINE>impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I</LINE>
<LINE>must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in</LINE>
<LINE>exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they</LINE>
<LINE>will say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great</LINE>
<LINE>ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the</LINE>
<LINE>instance? Tongue, I must put you into a</LINE>
<LINE>butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of</LINE>
<LINE>Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Is it possible he should know what he is, and be</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Titled goddess;</LINE>
<LINE>And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,</LINE>
<LINE>In your fine frame hath love no quality?</LINE>
<LINE>If quick fire of youth light not your mind,</LINE>
<LINE>You are no maiden, but a monument:</LINE>
<LINE>When you are dead, you should be such a one</LINE>
<LINE>As you are now, for you are cold and stem;</LINE>
<LINE>And now you should be as your mother was</LINE>
<LINE>When your sweet self was got.</LINE>

<LINE>If I should swear by God's great attributes,</LINE>
<LINE>I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,</LINE>
<LINE>When I did love you ill? This has no holding,</LINE>
<LINE>To swear by him whom I protest to love,</LINE>

<LINE>Change it, change it;</LINE>
<LINE>Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;</LINE>
<LINE>And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts</LINE>
<LINE>That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,</LINE>
<LINE>But give thyself unto my sick desires,</LINE>
<LINE>Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever</LINE>
<LINE>My love as it begins shall so persever.</LINE>

<LINE>I see that men make ropes in such a scarre</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>It is an honour 'longing to our house,</LINE>
<LINE>Bequeathed down from many ancestors;</LINE>
<LINE>Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world</LINE>
<LINE>In me to lose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Mine honour's such a ring:</LINE>
<LINE>My chastity's the jewel of our house,</LINE>
<LINE>Bequeathed down from many ancestors;</LINE>
<LINE>Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world</LINE>

<LINE>Brings in the champion Honour on my part,</LINE>
<LINE>Against your vain assault.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Here, take my ring:</LINE>

<LINE>When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll order take my mother shall not hear.</LINE>
<LINE>Now will I charge you in the band of truth,</LINE>
<LINE>When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,</LINE>
<LINE>Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:</LINE>
<LINE>My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them</LINE>
<LINE>When back again this ring shall be deliver'd:</LINE>
<LINE>And on your finger in the night I'll put</LINE>
<LINE>Another ring, that what in time proceeds</LINE>
<LINE>May token to the future our past deeds.</LINE>
<LINE>Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have won</LINE>
<LINE>A wife of me, though there my hope be done.</LINE>

<LINE>For which live long to thank both heaven and me!</LINE>
<LINE>You may so in the end.</LINE>
<LINE>My mother told me just how he would woo,</LINE>
<LINE>As if she sat in 's heart; she says all men</LINE>
<LINE>Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me</LINE>
<LINE>When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him</LINE>
<LINE>When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,</LINE>
<LINE>Marry that will, I live and die a maid:</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have not given him his mother's letter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have delivered it an hour since: there is</LINE>
<LINE>something in't that stings his nature; for on the</LINE>
<LINE>reading it he changed almost into another man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking</LINE>
<LINE>off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Especially he hath incurred the everlasting</LINE>
<LINE>displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his</LINE>
<LINE>bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a</LINE>
<LINE>thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the</LINE>
<LINE>grave of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in</LINE>
<LINE>Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he</LINE>
<LINE>fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath</LINE>
<LINE>given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself</LINE>
<LINE>made in the unchaste composition.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,</LINE>
<LINE>what things are we!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course</LINE>
<LINE>of all treasons, we still see them reveal</LINE>
<LINE>themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,</LINE>
<LINE>so he that in this action contrives against his own</LINE>
<LINE>nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of</LINE>
<LINE>our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his</LINE>
<LINE>company to-night?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see</LINE>
<LINE>his company anatomized, that he might take a measure</LINE>
<LINE>of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had</LINE>
<LINE>set this counterfeit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We will not meddle with him till he come; for his</LINE>
<LINE>presence must be the whip of the other.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hear there is an overture of peace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel</LINE>
<LINE>higher, or return again into France?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether</LINE>
<LINE>of his council.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal</LINE>
<LINE>of his act.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his</LINE>
<LINE>house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques</LINE>
<LINE>le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere</LINE>
<LINE>sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the</LINE>
<LINE>tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her</LINE>
<LINE>grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and</LINE>
<LINE>now she sings in heaven.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How is this justified?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The stronger part of it by her own letters, which</LINE>
<LINE>makes her story true, even to the point of her</LINE>
<LINE>death: her death itself, which could not be her</LINE>
<LINE>office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by</LINE>
<LINE>the rector of the place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath the count all this intelligence?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from</LINE>
<LINE>point, so to the full arming of the verity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And how mightily some other times we drown our gain</LINE>
<LINE>in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath</LINE>
<LINE>here acquired for him shall at home be encountered</LINE>
<LINE>with a shame as ample.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and</LINE>
<LINE>ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our</LINE>
<LINE>faults whipped them not; and our crimes would</LINE>
<LINE>despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now! where's your master?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath</LINE>
<LINE>taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next</LINE>
<LINE>morning for France. The duke hath offered him</LINE>
<LINE>letters of commendations to the king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They shall be no more than needful there, if they</LINE>
<LINE>were more than they can commend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.</LINE>
<LINE>Here's his lordship now.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter BERTRAM</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now, my lord! is't not after midnight?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a</LINE>
<LINE>month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:</LINE>
<LINE>I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his</LINE>
<LINE>nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my</LINE>
<LINE>lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;</LINE>
<LINE>and between these main parcels of dispatch effected</LINE>
<LINE>many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but</LINE>
<LINE>that I have not ended yet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If the business be of any difficulty, and this</LINE>
<LINE>morning your departure hence, it requires haste of</LINE>
<LINE>your lordship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to</LINE>
<LINE>hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this</LINE>
<LINE>dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,</LINE>
<LINE>bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived</LINE>
<LINE>me, like a double-meaning prophesier.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,</LINE>
<LINE>poor gallant knave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping</LINE>
<LINE>his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry</LINE>
<LINE>him. But to answer you as you would be understood;</LINE>
<LINE>he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he</LINE>
<LINE>hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes</LINE>
<LINE>to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to</LINE>
<LINE>this very instant disaster of his setting i' the</LINE>
<LINE>stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing of me, has a'?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his</LINE>

<LINE>are, you must have the patience to hear it.</LINE>

<LINE>Five or six thousand; but very weak and</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<LINE>Shall I set down your answer so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur</LINE>
<LINE>Parolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his own</LINE>
<LINE>phrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the</LINE>
<LINE>knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of</LINE>
<LINE>his dagger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword</LINE>
<LINE>clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him</LINE>
<LINE>by wearing his apparel neatly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Soldier</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, that's set down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Five or six thousand horse, I said,-- I will say</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He's very near the truth in this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>But I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he</LINE>

<LINE>Poor rogues, I pray you, say.</LINE>

<LINE>Well, that's set down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present</LINE>
<LINE>hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a</LINE>
<LINE>hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so</LINE>
<LINE>many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,</LINE>
<LINE>and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own</LINE>
<LINE>company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and</LINE>
<LINE>fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and</LINE>
<LINE>sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand</LINE>
<LINE>poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off</LINE>
<LINE>their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What shall be done to him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<LINE>Do you know this Captain Dumain?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Soldier</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is his reputation with the duke?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer</LINE>
<LINE>of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him</LINE>
<LINE>out o' the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>First Soldier</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, we'll search.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there,</LINE>

<LINE>Here 'tis; here's a paper: shall I read it to you?</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an</LINE>
<LINE>advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one</LINE>
<LINE>Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count</LINE>
<LINE>Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Soldier</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the</LINE>

<LINE>We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for</LINE>
<LINE>rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he</LINE>
<LINE>professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he</LINE>
<LINE>is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with</LINE>
<LINE>such volubility, that you would think truth were a</LINE>
<LINE>fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will</LINE>
<LINE>be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little</LINE>
<LINE>harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they</LINE>
<LINE>know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but</LINE>
<LINE>little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has</LINE>

<LINE>an honest man should have, he has nothing.</LINE>

<LINE>Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English</LINE>

<LINE>his soldiership I know not; except, in that country</LINE>
<LINE>he had the honour to be the officer at a place there</LINE>
<LINE>called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>There is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the</LINE>

<LINE>Time was, I did him a desired office,</LINE>

<LINE>Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,</LINE>

<LINE>No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta</LINE>

<LINE>made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in</LINE>

<LINE>by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would I had not known him; it was the death of the</LINE>
<LINE>most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had</LINE>
<LINE>praise for creating. If she had partaken of my</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So you were a knave at his service, indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Clown</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a</LINE>

<LINE>good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the</LINE>
<LINE>world; let his nobility remain in's court. I am for</LINE>
<LINE>the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be</LINE>
<LINE>too little for pomp to enter: some that humble</LINE>
<LINE>themselves may; but the many will be too chill and</LINE>
<LINE>tender, and they'll be for the flowery way that</LINE>
<LINE>leads to the broad gate and the great fire.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to</LINE>

<LINE>moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of</LINE>
<LINE>my daughter; which, in the minority of them both,</LINE>
<LINE>his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did</LINE>
<LINE>first propose: his highness hath promised me to do</LINE>
<LINE>it: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath</LINE>

<LINE>His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able</LINE>

<LINE>intelligence hath seldom failed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a</LINE>
<LINE>half, but his right cheek is worn bare.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Trumpets sound</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The king's coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah,</LINE>
<LINE>inquire further after me; I had talk of you last</LINE>
<LINE>night: though you are a fool and a knave, you shall</LINE>
<LINE>eat; go to, follow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I praise God for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE III.  Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two
French Lords, with Attendants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We lost a jewel of her; and our esteem</LINE>
<LINE>Was made much poorer by it: but your son,</LINE>
<LINE>As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know</LINE>
<LINE>Her estimation home.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis past, my liege;</LINE>
<LINE>And I beseech your majesty to make it</LINE>
<LINE>Natural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth;</LINE>
<LINE>When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,</LINE>
<LINE>O'erbears it and burns on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My honour'd lady,</LINE>
<LINE>I have forgiven and forgotten all;</LINE>
<LINE>Though my revenges were high bent upon him,</LINE>
<LINE>And watch'd the time to shoot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This I must say,</LINE>
<LINE>But first I beg my pardon, the young lord</LINE>
<LINE>Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady</LINE>
<LINE>Offence of mighty note; but to himself</LINE>
<LINE>The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife</LINE>
<LINE>Whose beauty did astonish the survey</LINE>
<LINE>Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve</LINE>
<LINE>Humbly call'd mistress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Praising what is lost</LINE>
<LINE>Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;</LINE>
<LINE>We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill</LINE>
<LINE>All repetition: let him not ask our pardon;</LINE>
<LINE>The nature of his great offence is dead,</LINE>
<LINE>And deeper than oblivion we do bury</LINE>
<LINE>The incensing relics of it: let him approach,</LINE>
<LINE>A stranger, no offender; and inform him</LINE>
<LINE>So 'tis our will he should.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall, my liege.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What says he to your daughter? have you spoke?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All that he is hath reference to your highness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me</LINE>
<LINE>That set him high in fame.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter BERTRAM</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He looks well on't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am not a day of season,</LINE>
<LINE>For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail</LINE>
<LINE>In me at once: but to the brightest beams</LINE>
<LINE>Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;</LINE>
<LINE>The time is fair again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My high-repented blames,</LINE>
<LINE>Dear sovereign, pardon to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All is whole;</LINE>
<LINE>Not one word more of the consumed time.</LINE>
<LINE>Let's take the instant by the forward top;</LINE>
<LINE>For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees</LINE>
<LINE>The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time</LINE>
<LINE>Steals ere we can effect them. You remember</LINE>
<LINE>The daughter of this lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Admiringly, my liege, at first</LINE>
<LINE>I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart</LINE>
<LINE>Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Where the impression of mine eye infixing,</LINE>
<LINE>Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,</LINE>
<LINE>Which warp'd the line of every other favour;</LINE>
<LINE>Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;</LINE>
<LINE>Extended or contracted all proportions</LINE>
<LINE>To a most hideous object: thence it came</LINE>
<LINE>That she whom all men praised and whom myself,</LINE>
<LINE>Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye</LINE>
<LINE>The dust that did offend it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well excused:</LINE>
<LINE>That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away</LINE>
<LINE>From the great compt: but love that comes too late,</LINE>
<LINE>Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,</LINE>
<LINE>To the great sender turns a sour offence,</LINE>
<LINE>Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults</LINE>
<LINE>Make trivial price of serious things we have,</LINE>
<LINE>Not knowing them until we know their grave:</LINE>
<LINE>Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,</LINE>
<LINE>Destroy our friends and after weep their dust</LINE>
<LINE>Our own love waking cries to see what's done,</LINE>
<LINE>While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.</LINE>
<LINE>Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.</LINE>
<LINE>Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:</LINE>
<LINE>The main consents are had; and here we'll stay</LINE>
<LINE>To see our widower's second marriage-day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!</LINE>
<LINE>Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come on, my son, in whom my house's name</LINE>
<LINE>Must be digested, give a favour from you</LINE>
<LINE>To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>That she may quickly come.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>BERTRAM gives a ring</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>By my old beard,</LINE>
<LINE>And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,</LINE>
<LINE>The last that e'er I took her at court,</LINE>
<LINE>I saw upon her finger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hers it was not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,</LINE>
<LINE>While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.</LINE>
<LINE>This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,</LINE>
<LINE>I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood</LINE>
<LINE>Necessitied to help, that by this token</LINE>
<LINE>I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave</LINE>
<LINE>her</LINE>
<LINE>Of what should stead her most?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My gracious sovereign,</LINE>
<LINE>Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,</LINE>
<LINE>The ring was never hers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Son, on my life,</LINE>
<LINE>I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it</LINE>
<LINE>At her life's rate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sure I saw her wear it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:</LINE>
<LINE>In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,</LINE>
<LINE>Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name</LINE>
<LINE>Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought</LINE>
<LINE>I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed</LINE>
<LINE>To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully</LINE>
<LINE>I could not answer in that course of honour</LINE>
<LINE>As she had made the overture, she ceased</LINE>
<LINE>In heavy satisfaction and would never</LINE>
<LINE>Receive the ring again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Plutus himself,</LINE>
<LINE>That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath not in nature's mystery more science</LINE>
<LINE>Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,</LINE>
<LINE>Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know</LINE>
<LINE>That you are well acquainted with yourself,</LINE>
<LINE>Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement</LINE>
<LINE>You got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety</LINE>
<LINE>That she would never put it from her finger,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,</LINE>
<LINE>Where you have never come, or sent it us</LINE>
<LINE>Upon her great disaster.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She never saw it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;</LINE>
<LINE>And makest conjectural fears to come into me</LINE>
<LINE>Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove</LINE>
<LINE>That thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;--</LINE>
<LINE>And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,</LINE>
<LINE>And she is dead; which nothing, but to close</LINE>
<LINE>Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,</LINE>
<LINE>More than to see this ring. Take him away.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Guards seize BERTRAM</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall tax my fears of little vanity,</LINE>
<LINE>Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him!</LINE>
<LINE>We'll sift this matter further.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you shall prove</LINE>
<LINE>This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy</LINE>
<LINE>Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,</LINE>
<LINE>Where yet she never was.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit, guarded</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Gentleman</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gracious sovereign,</LINE>
<LINE>Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:</LINE>
<LINE>Here's a petition from a Florentine,</LINE>
<LINE>Who hath for four or five removes come short</LINE>
<LINE>To tender it herself. I undertook it,</LINE>
<LINE>Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech</LINE>
<LINE>Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know</LINE>
<LINE>Is here attending: her business looks in her</LINE>
<LINE>With an importing visage; and she told me,</LINE>
<LINE>In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern</LINE>
<LINE>Your highness with herself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>  Upon his many protestations to marry me</LINE>
<LINE>when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won</LINE>
<LINE>me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows</LINE>
<LINE>are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. He</LINE>
<LINE>stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow</LINE>
<LINE>him to his country for justice: grant it me, O</LINE>
<LINE>king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer</LINE>
<LINE>flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.</LINE>
<LINE>DIANA CAPILET.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for</LINE>
<LINE>this: I'll none of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,</LINE>
<LINE>To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors:</LINE>
<LINE>Go speedily and bring again the count.</LINE>
<LINE>I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,</LINE>
<LINE>Was foully snatch'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, justice on the doers!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter BERTRAM, guarded</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you,</LINE>
<LINE>And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet you desire to marry.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Widow and DIANA</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What woman's that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,</LINE>
<LINE>Derived from the ancient Capilet:</LINE>
<LINE>My suit, as I do understand, you know,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore know how far I may be pitied.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour</LINE>
<LINE>Both suffer under this complaint we bring,</LINE>
<LINE>And both shall cease, without your remedy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come hither, count; do you know these women?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I neither can nor will deny</LINE>
<LINE>But that I know them: do they charge me further?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why do you look so strange upon your wife?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She's none of mine, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you shall marry,</LINE>
<LINE>You give away this hand, and that is mine;</LINE>
<LINE>You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;</LINE>
<LINE>You give away myself, which is known mine;</LINE>
<LINE>For I by vow am so embodied yours,</LINE>
<LINE>That she which marries you must marry me,</LINE>
<LINE>Either both or none.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you</LINE>
<LINE>are no husband for her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom sometime I have laugh'd with: let your highness</LINE>
<LINE>Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour</LINE>
<LINE>Than for to think that I would sink it here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend</LINE>
<LINE>Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour</LINE>
<LINE>Than in my thought it lies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Ask him upon his oath, if he does think</LINE>
<LINE>He had not my virginity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What say'st thou to her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She's impudent, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>And was a common gamester to the camp.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,</LINE>
<LINE>He might have bought me at a common price:</LINE>
<LINE>Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose high respect and rich validity</LINE>
<LINE>Did lack a parallel; yet for all that</LINE>
<LINE>He gave it to a commoner o' the camp,</LINE>
<LINE>If I be one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He blushes, and 'tis it:</LINE>
<LINE>Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,</LINE>
<LINE>Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;</LINE>
<LINE>That ring's a thousand proofs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Methought you said</LINE>
<LINE>You saw one here in court could witness it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did, my lord, but loath am to produce</LINE>
<LINE>So bad an instrument: his name's Parolles.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I saw the man to-day, if man he be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Find him, and bring him hither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit an Attendant</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What of him?</LINE>
<LINE>He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,</LINE>
<LINE>With all the spots o' the world tax'd and debosh'd;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.</LINE>
<LINE>Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,</LINE>
<LINE>That will speak any thing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She hath that ring of yours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think she has: certain it is I liked her,</LINE>
<LINE>And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth:</LINE>
<LINE>She knew her distance and did angle for me,</LINE>
<LINE>Madding my eagerness with her restraint,</LINE>
<LINE>As all impediments in fancy's course</LINE>
<LINE>Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,</LINE>
<LINE>Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;</LINE>
<LINE>And I had that which any inferior might</LINE>
<LINE>At market-price have bought.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must be patient:</LINE>
<LINE>You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,</LINE>
<LINE>May justly diet me. I pray you yet;</LINE>
<LINE>Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;</LINE>
<LINE>Send for your ring, I will return it home,</LINE>
<LINE>And give me mine again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have it not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What ring was yours, I pray you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, much like</LINE>
<LINE>The same upon your finger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And this was it I gave him, being abed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The story then goes false, you threw it him</LINE>
<LINE>Out of a casement.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have spoke the truth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter PAROLLES</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.</LINE>
<LINE>Is this the man you speak of?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,</LINE>
<LINE>Not fearing the displeasure of your master,</LINE>
<LINE>Which on your just proceeding I'll keep off,</LINE>
<LINE>By him and by this woman here what know you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So please your majesty, my master hath been an</LINE>
<LINE>honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him,</LINE>
<LINE>which gentlemen have.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How, I pray you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How is that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He loved her, sir, and loved her not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an</LINE>
<LINE>equivocal companion is this!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you know he promised me marriage?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, I know more than I'll speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAROLLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them,</LINE>
<LINE>as I said; but more than that, he loved her: for</LINE>
<LINE>indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and</LINE>
<LINE>of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I</LINE>
<LINE>was in that credit with them at that time that I</LINE>
<LINE>knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,</LINE>
<LINE>as promising her marriage, and things which would</LINE>
<LINE>derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not</LINE>
<LINE>speak what I know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say</LINE>
<LINE>they are married: but thou art too fine in thy</LINE>
<LINE>evidence; therefore stand aside.</LINE>
<LINE>This ring, you say, was yours?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my good lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who lent it you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was not lent me neither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where did you find it, then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I found it not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it were yours by none of all these ways,</LINE>
<LINE>How could you give it him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I never gave it him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAFEU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off</LINE>
<LINE>and on at pleasure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take her away; I do not like her now;</LINE>
<LINE>To prison with her: and away with him.</LINE>
<LINE>Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou diest within this hour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll never tell you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take her away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll put in bail, my liege.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty:</LINE>
<LINE>He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.</LINE>
<LINE>Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;</LINE>
<LINE>I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Widow</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,</LINE>
<LINE>And he shall surety me. But for this lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,</LINE>
<LINE>Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:</LINE>
<LINE>He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;</LINE>
<LINE>And at that time he got his wife with child:</LINE>
<LINE>Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:</LINE>
<LINE>So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:</LINE>
<LINE>And now behold the meaning.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is there no exorcist</LINE>
<LINE>Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?</LINE>
<LINE>Is't real that I see?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HELENA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O my good lord, when I was like this maid,</LINE>
<LINE>I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;</LINE>
<LINE>And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:</LINE>
<LINE>'When from my finger you can get this ring</LINE>
<LINE>And are by me with child,' c. This is done:</LINE>
<LINE>Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERTRAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,</LINE>

<LINE>O my dear mother, do I see you living?</LINE>

<LINE>Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,</LINE>
<LINE>I thank thee: wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee:</LINE>
<LINE>Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let us from point to point this story know,</LINE>
<LINE>To make the even truth in pleasure flow.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To DIANA</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,</LINE>
<LINE>Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;</LINE>
<LINE>For I can guess that by thy honest aid</LINE>
<LINE>Thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ORLANDO and ADAM</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion</LINE>
<LINE>bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,</LINE>
<LINE>and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his</LINE>
<LINE>blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my</LINE>
<LINE>sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and</LINE>
<LINE>report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,</LINE>
<LINE>he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more</LINE>
<LINE>properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you</LINE>
<LINE>that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that</LINE>
<LINE>differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses</LINE>
<LINE>are bred better; for, besides that they are fair</LINE>
<LINE>with their feeding, they are taught their manage,</LINE>
<LINE>and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his</LINE>
<LINE>brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the</LINE>
<LINE>which his animals on his dunghills are as much</LINE>
<LINE>bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so</LINE>
<LINE>plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave</LINE>
<LINE>me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets</LINE>
<LINE>me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a</LINE>
<LINE>brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my</LINE>
<LINE>gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that</LINE>
<LINE>grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I</LINE>
<LINE>think is within me, begins to mutiny against this</LINE>
<LINE>servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I</LINE>
<LINE>know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yonder comes my master, your brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter OLIVER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, sir! what make you here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What mar you then, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God</LINE>
<LINE>made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?</LINE>
<LINE>What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should</LINE>
<LINE>come to such penury?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know you where your are, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know you before whom, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know</LINE>
<LINE>you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle</LINE>
<LINE>condition of blood, you should so know me. The</LINE>
<LINE>courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that</LINE>
<LINE>you are the first-born; but the same tradition</LINE>
<LINE>takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers</LINE>
<LINE>betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as</LINE>
<LINE>you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is</LINE>
<LINE>nearer to his reverence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, boy!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir</LINE>
<LINE>Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice</LINE>
<LINE>a villain that says such a father begot villains.</LINE>
<LINE>Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand</LINE>
<LINE>from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy</LINE>
<LINE>tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's</LINE>
<LINE>remembrance, be at accord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me go, I say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My</LINE>
<LINE>father charged you in his will to give me good</LINE>
<LINE>education: you have trained me like a peasant,</LINE>
<LINE>obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like</LINE>
<LINE>qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in</LINE>
<LINE>me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow</LINE>
<LINE>me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or</LINE>
<LINE>give me the poor allottery my father left me by</LINE>
<LINE>testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?</LINE>
<LINE>Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled</LINE>
<LINE>with you; you shall have some part of your will: I</LINE>
<LINE>pray you, leave me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Get you with him, you old dog.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my</LINE>
<LINE>teeth in your service. God be with my old master!</LINE>
<LINE>he would not have spoke such a word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will</LINE>

<LINE>Call him in.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit DENNIS</STAGEDIR>

</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CHARLES</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow to your worship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the</LINE>
<LINE>new court?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:</LINE>
<LINE>that is, the old duke is banished by his younger</LINE>
<LINE>brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords</LINE>
<LINE>have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,</LINE>
<LINE>whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;</LINE>
<LINE>therefore he gives them good leave to wander.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be</LINE>
<LINE>banished with her father?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves</LINE>
<LINE>her, being ever from their cradles bred together,</LINE>
<LINE>that she would have followed her exile, or have died</LINE>
<LINE>to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no</LINE>
<LINE>less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and</LINE>
<LINE>never two ladies loved as they do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where will the old duke live?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and</LINE>
<LINE>a many merry men with him; and there they live like</LINE>
<LINE>the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young</LINE>
<LINE>gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time</LINE>
<LINE>carelessly, as they did in the golden world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a</LINE>
<LINE>matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand</LINE>
<LINE>that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition</LINE>
<LINE>to come in disguised against me to try a fall.</LINE>
<LINE>To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that</LINE>
<LINE>escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him</LINE>
<LINE>well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,</LINE>
<LINE>for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I</LINE>
<LINE>must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,</LINE>
<LINE>out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you</LINE>
<LINE>withal, that either you might stay him from his</LINE>
<LINE>intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall</LINE>
<LINE>run into, in that it is a thing of his own search</LINE>
<LINE>and altogether against my will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which</LINE>
<LINE>thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had</LINE>
<LINE>myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and</LINE>
<LINE>have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from</LINE>
<LINE>it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:</LINE>
<LINE>it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full</LINE>
<LINE>of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's</LINE>
<LINE>good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against</LINE>
<LINE>me his natural brother: therefore use thy</LINE>
<LINE>discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck</LINE>
<LINE>as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if</LINE>
<LINE>thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not</LINE>
<LINE>mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise</LINE>
<LINE>against thee by poison, entrap thee by some</LINE>
<LINE>treacherous device and never leave thee till he</LINE>
<LINE>hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;</LINE>
<LINE>for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak</LINE>
<LINE>it, there is not one so young and so villanous this</LINE>
<LINE>day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but</LINE>
<LINE>should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must</LINE>
<LINE>blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come</LINE>
<LINE>to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go</LINE>
<LINE>alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and</LINE>
<LINE>so God keep your worship!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, good Charles.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit CHARLES</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see</LINE>
<LINE>an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,</LINE>
<LINE>hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never</LINE>
<LINE>schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of</LINE>
<LINE>all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much</LINE>
<LINE>in the heart of the world, and especially of my own</LINE>
<LINE>people, who best know him, that I am altogether</LINE>
<LINE>misprised: but it shall not be so long; this</LINE>
<LINE>wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that</LINE>
<LINE>I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  Lawn before the Duke's palace.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter CELIA and ROSALIND</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;</LINE>
<LINE>and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could</LINE>
<LINE>teach me to forget a banished father, you must not</LINE>
<LINE>learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight</LINE>
<LINE>that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,</LINE>
<LINE>had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou</LINE>
<LINE>hadst been still with me, I could have taught my</LINE>
<LINE>love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,</LINE>
<LINE>if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously</LINE>
<LINE>tempered as mine is to thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to</LINE>
<LINE>rejoice in yours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is</LINE>
<LINE>like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt</LINE>
<LINE>be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy</LINE>
<LINE>father perforce, I will render thee again in</LINE>
<LINE>affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break</LINE>
<LINE>that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my</LINE>
<LINE>sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let</LINE>
<LINE>me see; what think you of falling in love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but</LINE>
<LINE>love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport</LINE>
<LINE>neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst</LINE>
<LINE>in honour come off again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What shall be our sport, then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from</LINE>
<LINE>her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would we could do so, for her benefits are</LINE>
<LINE>mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman</LINE>
<LINE>doth most mistake in her gifts to women.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce</LINE>
<LINE>makes honest, and those that she makes honest she</LINE>
<LINE>makes very ill-favouredly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to</LINE>
<LINE>Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,</LINE>
<LINE>not in the lineaments of Nature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter TOUCHSTONE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she</LINE>
<LINE>not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature</LINE>
<LINE>hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not</LINE>
<LINE>Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when</LINE>
<LINE>Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of</LINE>
<LINE>Nature's wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but</LINE>
<LINE>Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull</LINE>
<LINE>to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this</LINE>
<LINE>natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of</LINE>
<LINE>the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,</LINE>
<LINE>wit! whither wander you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistress, you must come away to your father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were you made the messenger?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where learned you that oath, fool?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they</LINE>
<LINE>were good pancakes and swore by his honour the</LINE>
<LINE>mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the</LINE>
<LINE>pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and</LINE>
<LINE>yet was not the knight forsworn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How prove you that, in the great heap of your</LINE>
<LINE>knowledge?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and</LINE>
<LINE>swear by your beards that I am a knave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By our beards, if we had them, thou art.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you</LINE>
<LINE>swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no</LINE>
<LINE>more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he</LINE>
<LINE>never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away</LINE>
<LINE>before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One that old Frederick, your father, loves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!</LINE>
<LINE>speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation</LINE>
<LINE>one of these days.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what</LINE>
<LINE>wise men do foolishly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little</LINE>
<LINE>wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery</LINE>
<LINE>that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes</LINE>
<LINE>Monsieur Le Beau.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With his mouth full of news.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then shall we be news-crammed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All the better; we shall be the more marketable.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter LE BEAU</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sport! of what colour?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As wit and fortune will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or as the Destinies decree.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, if I keep not my rank,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou losest thy old smell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good</LINE>
<LINE>wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You tell us the manner of the wrestling.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please</LINE>
<LINE>your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is</LINE>
<LINE>yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming</LINE>
<LINE>to perform it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There comes an old man and his three sons,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I could match this beginning with an old tale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men</LINE>
<LINE>by these presents.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the</LINE>
<LINE>duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him</LINE>
<LINE>and broke three of his ribs, that there is little</LINE>
<LINE>hope of life in him: so he served the second, and</LINE>
<LINE>so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,</LINE>
<LINE>their father, making such pitiful dole over them</LINE>
<LINE>that all the beholders take his part with weeping.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies</LINE>
<LINE>have lost?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, this that I speak of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first</LINE>
<LINE>time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport</LINE>
<LINE>for ladies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or I, I promise thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But is there any else longs to see this broken music</LINE>
<LINE>in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon</LINE>
<LINE>rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must, if you stay here; for here is the place</LINE>
<LINE>appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to</LINE>
<LINE>perform it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO,
CHARLES, and Attendants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his</LINE>
<LINE>own peril on his forwardness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is yonder the man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even he, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither</LINE>
<LINE>to see the wrestling?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;</LINE>
<LINE>there is such odds in the man. In pity of the</LINE>
<LINE>challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he</LINE>
<LINE>will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if</LINE>
<LINE>you can move him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do so: I'll not be by.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I attend them with all respect and duty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I</LINE>
<LINE>come but in, as others do, to try with him the</LINE>
<LINE>strength of my youth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your</LINE>
<LINE>years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's</LINE>
<LINE>strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or</LINE>
<LINE>knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your</LINE>
<LINE>adventure would counsel you to a more equal</LINE>
<LINE>enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to</LINE>
<LINE>embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore</LINE>
<LINE>be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke</LINE>
<LINE>that the wrestling might not go forward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I beseech you, punish me not with your hard</LINE>
<LINE>thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny</LINE>
<LINE>so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let</LINE>
<LINE>your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my</LINE>
<LINE>trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one</LINE>
<LINE>shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one</LINE>
<LINE>dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my</LINE>
<LINE>friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the</LINE>
<LINE>world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in</LINE>
<LINE>the world I fill up a place, which may be better</LINE>
<LINE>supplied when I have made it empty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And mine, to eke out hers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your heart's desires be with you!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, where is this young gallant that is so</LINE>
<LINE>desirous to lie with his mother earth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall try but one fall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him</LINE>
<LINE>to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him</LINE>
<LINE>from a first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An you mean to mock me after, you should not have</LINE>
<LINE>mocked me before: but come your ways.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would I were invisible, to catch the strong</LINE>
<LINE>fellow by the leg.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They wrestle</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O excellent young man!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who</LINE>
<LINE>should down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Shout. CHARLES is thrown</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more, no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How dost thou, Charles?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He cannot speak, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would thou hadst been son to some man else:</LINE>
<LINE>The world esteem'd thy father honourable,</LINE>
<LINE>But I did find him still mine enemy:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,</LINE>
<LINE>Hadst thou descended from another house.</LINE>
<LINE>But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:</LINE>
<LINE>I would thou hadst told me of another father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were I my father, coz, would I do this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,</LINE>
<LINE>His youngest son; and would not change that calling,</LINE>
<LINE>To be adopted heir to Frederick.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the world was of my father's mind:</LINE>
<LINE>Had I before known this young man his son,</LINE>
<LINE>I should have given him tears unto entreaties,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere he should thus have ventured.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentle cousin,</LINE>
<LINE>Let us go thank him and encourage him:</LINE>
<LINE>My father's rough and envious disposition</LINE>
<LINE>Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:</LINE>
<LINE>If you do keep your promises in love</LINE>
<LINE>But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,</LINE>
<LINE>Your mistress shall be happy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentleman,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Giving him a chain from her neck</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.</LINE>
<LINE>Shall we go, coz?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts</LINE>
<LINE>Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up</LINE>
<LINE>Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?</LINE>
<LINE>Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown</LINE>
<LINE>More than your enemies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you go, coz?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have with you. Fare you well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.</LINE>
<LINE>O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!</LINE>
<LINE>Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter LE BEAU</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you</LINE>
<LINE>To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved</LINE>
<LINE>High commendation, true applause and love,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet such is now the duke's condition</LINE>
<LINE>That he misconstrues all that you have done.</LINE>
<LINE>The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:</LINE>
<LINE>Which of the two was daughter of the duke</LINE>
<LINE>That here was at the wrestling?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LE BEAU</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;</LINE>
<LINE>But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter</LINE>
<LINE>The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,</LINE>
<LINE>And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,</LINE>
<LINE>To keep his daughter company; whose loves</LINE>
<LINE>Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.</LINE>
<LINE>But I can tell you that of late this duke</LINE>
<LINE>Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,</LINE>
<LINE>Grounded upon no other argument</LINE>
<LINE>But that the people praise her for her virtues</LINE>
<LINE>And pity her for her good father's sake;</LINE>
<LINE>And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady</LINE>
<LINE>Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:</LINE>
<LINE>Hereafter, in a better world than this,</LINE>
<LINE>I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit LE BEAU</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;</LINE>
<LINE>From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:</LINE>
<LINE>But heavenly Rosalind!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE III.  A room in the palace.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter CELIA and ROSALIND</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not one to throw at a dog.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon</LINE>
<LINE>curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one</LINE>
<LINE>should be lamed with reasons and the other mad</LINE>
<LINE>without any.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But is all this for your father?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how</LINE>
<LINE>full of briers is this working-day world!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in</LINE>
<LINE>holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden</LINE>
<LINE>paths our very petticoats will catch them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hem them away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in</LINE>
<LINE>despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of</LINE>
<LINE>service, let us talk in good earnest: is it</LINE>
<LINE>possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so</LINE>
<LINE>strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The duke my father loved his father dearly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son</LINE>
<LINE>dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,</LINE>
<LINE>for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate</LINE>
<LINE>not Orlando.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me love him for that, and do you love him</LINE>
<LINE>because I do. Look, here comes the duke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With his eyes full of anger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste</LINE>
<LINE>And get you from our court.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Me, uncle?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You, cousin</LINE>
<LINE>Within these ten days if that thou be'st found</LINE>
<LINE>So near our public court as twenty miles,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou diest for it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do beseech your grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:</LINE>
<LINE>If with myself I hold intelligence</LINE>
<LINE>Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,</LINE>
<LINE>If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--</LINE>
<LINE>As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,</LINE>
<LINE>Never so much as in a thought unborn</LINE>
<LINE>Did I offend your highness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus do all traitors:</LINE>
<LINE>If their purgation did consist in words,</LINE>
<LINE>They are as innocent as grace itself:</LINE>
<LINE>Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So was I when your highness took his dukedom;</LINE>
<LINE>So was I when your highness banish'd him:</LINE>
<LINE>Treason is not inherited, my lord;</LINE>
<LINE>Or, if we did derive it from our friends,</LINE>
<LINE>What's that to me? my father was no traitor:</LINE>
<LINE>Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much</LINE>
<LINE>To think my poverty is treacherous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dear sovereign, hear me speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,</LINE>
<LINE>Else had she with her father ranged along.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did not then entreat to have her stay;</LINE>
<LINE>It was your pleasure and your own remorse:</LINE>
<LINE>I was too young that time to value her;</LINE>
<LINE>But now I know her: if she be a traitor,</LINE>
<LINE>Why so am I; we still have slept together,</LINE>
<LINE>Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,</LINE>
<LINE>And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,</LINE>
<LINE>Still we went coupled and inseparable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,</LINE>
<LINE>Her very silence and her patience</LINE>
<LINE>Speak to the people, and they pity her.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;</LINE>
<LINE>And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous</LINE>
<LINE>When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:</LINE>
<LINE>Firm and irrevocable is my doom</LINE>
<LINE>Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot live out of her company.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.</LINE>
<LINE>I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have more cause.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast not, cousin;</LINE>
<LINE>Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke</LINE>
<LINE>Hath banish'd me, his daughter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That he hath not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love</LINE>
<LINE>Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:</LINE>
<LINE>Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?</LINE>
<LINE>No: let my father seek another heir.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore devise with me how we may fly,</LINE>
<LINE>Whither to go and what to bear with us;</LINE>
<LINE>And do not seek to take your change upon you,</LINE>
<LINE>To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;</LINE>
<LINE>For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,</LINE>
<LINE>Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, whither shall we go?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, what danger will it be to us,</LINE>
<LINE>Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!</LINE>
<LINE>Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll put myself in poor and mean attire</LINE>
<LINE>And with a kind of umber smirch my face;</LINE>
<LINE>The like do you: so shall we pass along</LINE>
<LINE>And never stir assailants.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were it not better,</LINE>
<LINE>Because that I am more than common tall,</LINE>
<LINE>That I did suit me all points like a man?</LINE>
<LINE>A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,</LINE>
<LINE>A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart</LINE>
<LINE>Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--</LINE>
<LINE>We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,</LINE>
<LINE>As many other mannish cowards have</LINE>
<LINE>That do outface it with their semblances.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What shall I call thee when thou art a man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore look you call me Ganymede.</LINE>
<LINE>But what will you be call'd?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Something that hath a reference to my state</LINE>
<LINE>No longer Celia, but Aliena.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal</LINE>
<LINE>The clownish fool out of your father's court?</LINE>
<LINE>Would he not be a comfort to our travel?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;</LINE>
<LINE>Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,</LINE>
<LINE>And get our jewels and our wealth together,</LINE>
<LINE>Devise the fittest time and safest way</LINE>
<LINE>To hide us from pursuit that will be made</LINE>
<LINE>After my flight. Now go we in content</LINE>
<LINE>To liberty and not to banishment.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three Lords,
like foresters</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath not old custom made this life more sweet</LINE>
<LINE>Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods</LINE>
<LINE>More free from peril than the envious court?</LINE>
<LINE>Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,</LINE>
<LINE>The seasons' difference, as the icy fang</LINE>
<LINE>And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,</LINE>
<LINE>Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say</LINE>
<LINE>'This is no flattery: these are counsellors</LINE>
<LINE>That feelingly persuade me what I am.'</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet are the uses of adversity,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,</LINE>
<LINE>Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;</LINE>
<LINE>And this our life exempt from public haunt</LINE>
<LINE>Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,</LINE>
<LINE>Sermons in stones and good in every thing.</LINE>
<LINE>I would not change it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AMIENS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Happy is your grace,</LINE>
<LINE>That can translate the stubbornness of fortune</LINE>
<LINE>Into so quiet and so sweet a style.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, shall we go and kill us venison?</LINE>
<LINE>And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,</LINE>
<LINE>Being native burghers of this desert city,</LINE>
<LINE>Should in their own confines with forked heads</LINE>
<LINE>Have their round haunches gored.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,</LINE>
<LINE>And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp</LINE>
<LINE>Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.</LINE>
<LINE>To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself</LINE>
<LINE>Did steal behind him as he lay along</LINE>
<LINE>Under an oak whose antique root peeps out</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:</LINE>
<LINE>To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,</LINE>
<LINE>That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,</LINE>
<LINE>Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>The wretched animal heaved forth such groans</LINE>
<LINE>That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat</LINE>
<LINE>Almost to bursting, and the big round tears</LINE>
<LINE>Coursed one another down his innocent nose</LINE>
<LINE>In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool</LINE>
<LINE>Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,</LINE>
<LINE>Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,</LINE>
<LINE>Augmenting it with tears.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But what said Jaques?</LINE>
<LINE>Did he not moralize this spectacle?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, yes, into a thousand similes.</LINE>
<LINE>First, for his weeping into the needless stream;</LINE>
<LINE>'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament</LINE>
<LINE>As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more</LINE>
<LINE>To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,</LINE>
<LINE>Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,</LINE>
<LINE>''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part</LINE>
<LINE>The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,</LINE>
<LINE>Full of the pasture, jumps along by him</LINE>
<LINE>And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,</LINE>
<LINE>'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look</LINE>
<LINE>Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'</LINE>
<LINE>Thus most invectively he pierceth through</LINE>
<LINE>The body of the country, city, court,</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we</LINE>
<LINE>Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,</LINE>
<LINE>To fright the animals and to kill them up</LINE>
<LINE>In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And did you leave him in this contemplation?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We did, my lord, weeping and commenting</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the sobbing deer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Show me the place:</LINE>
<LINE>I love to cope him in these sullen fits,</LINE>
<LINE>For then he's full of matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll bring you to him straight.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can it be possible that no man saw them?</LINE>
<LINE>It cannot be: some villains of my court</LINE>
<LINE>Are of consent and sufferance in this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot hear of any that did see her.</LINE>
<LINE>The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,</LINE>
<LINE>Saw her abed, and in the morning early</LINE>
<LINE>They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft</LINE>
<LINE>Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.</LINE>
<LINE>Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,</LINE>
<LINE>Confesses that she secretly o'erheard</LINE>
<LINE>Your daughter and her cousin much commend</LINE>
<LINE>The parts and graces of the wrestler</LINE>
<LINE>That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;</LINE>
<LINE>And she believes, wherever they are gone,</LINE>
<LINE>That youth is surely in their company.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;</LINE>
<LINE>If he be absent, bring his brother to me;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ORLANDO and ADAM, meeting</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who's there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, my young master? O, my gentle master!</LINE>
<LINE>O my sweet master! O you memory</LINE>
<LINE>Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?</LINE>
<LINE>Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?</LINE>
<LINE>And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?</LINE>
<LINE>Why would you be so fond to overcome</LINE>
<LINE>The bonny priser of the humorous duke?</LINE>
<LINE>Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.</LINE>
<LINE>Know you not, master, to some kind of men</LINE>
<LINE>Their graces serve them but as enemies?</LINE>
<LINE>No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,</LINE>
<LINE>Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.</LINE>
<LINE>O, what a world is this, when what is comely</LINE>
<LINE>Envenoms him that bears it!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what's the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O unhappy youth!</LINE>
<LINE>Come not within these doors; within this roof</LINE>
<LINE>The enemy of all your graces lives:</LINE>
<LINE>Your brother--no, no brother; yet the son--</LINE>
<LINE>Yet not the son, I will not call him son</LINE>
<LINE>Of him I was about to call his father--</LINE>
<LINE>Hath heard your praises, and this night he means</LINE>
<LINE>To burn the lodging where you use to lie</LINE>
<LINE>And you within it: if he fail of that,</LINE>
<LINE>He will have other means to cut you off.</LINE>
<LINE>I overheard him and his practises.</LINE>
<LINE>This is no place; this house is but a butchery:</LINE>
<LINE>Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No matter whither, so you come not here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?</LINE>
<LINE>Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce</LINE>
<LINE>A thievish living on the common road?</LINE>
<LINE>This I must do, or know not what to do:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet this I will not do, do how I can;</LINE>
<LINE>I rather will subject me to the malice</LINE>
<LINE>Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,</LINE>
<LINE>The thrifty hire I saved under your father,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I did store to be my foster-nurse</LINE>
<LINE>When service should in my old limbs lie lame</LINE>
<LINE>And unregarded age in corners thrown:</LINE>
<LINE>Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,</LINE>
<LINE>Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;</LINE>
<LINE>And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:</LINE>
<LINE>Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;</LINE>
<LINE>For in my youth I never did apply</LINE>
<LINE>Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo</LINE>
<LINE>The means of weakness and debility;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,</LINE>
<LINE>Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll do the service of a younger man</LINE>
<LINE>In all your business and necessities.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O good old man, how well in thee appears</LINE>
<LINE>The constant service of the antique world,</LINE>
<LINE>When service sweat for duty, not for meed!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art not for the fashion of these times,</LINE>
<LINE>Where none will sweat but for promotion,</LINE>
<LINE>And having that, do choke their service up</LINE>
<LINE>Even with the having: it is not so with thee.</LINE>
<LINE>But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,</LINE>
<LINE>That cannot so much as a blossom yield</LINE>
<LINE>In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry</LINE>
<LINE>But come thy ways; well go along together,</LINE>
<LINE>And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,</LINE>
<LINE>We'll light upon some settled low content.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master, go on, and I will follow thee,</LINE>
<LINE>To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.</LINE>
<LINE>From seventeen years till now almost fourscore</LINE>
<LINE>Here lived I, but now live here no more.</LINE>
<LINE>At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;</LINE>
<LINE>But at fourscore it is too late a week:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet fortune cannot recompense me better</LINE>
<LINE>Than to die well and not my master's debtor.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's</LINE>
<LINE>apparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort</LINE>
<LINE>the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show</LINE>
<LINE>itself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage,</LINE>
<LINE>good Aliena!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, bear with me; I cannot go no further.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear</LINE>
<LINE>you; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you,</LINE>
<LINE>for I think you have no money in your purse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, this is the forest of Arden.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was</LINE>

<LINE>That is the way to make her scorn you still.</LINE>

<LINE>O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I partly guess; for I have loved ere now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,</LINE>
<LINE>Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover</LINE>
<LINE>As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow:</LINE>
<LINE>But if thy love were ever like to mine--</LINE>
<LINE>As sure I think did never man love so--</LINE>
<LINE>How many actions most ridiculous</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Into a thousand that I have forgotten.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!</LINE>
<LINE>If thou remember'st not the slightest folly</LINE>
<LINE>That ever love did make thee run into,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast not loved:</LINE>
<LINE>Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,</LINE>
<LINE>Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast not loved:</LINE>
<LINE>Or if thou hast not broke from company</LINE>
<LINE>Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast not loved.</LINE>
<LINE>O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,</LINE>
<LINE>I have by hard adventure found mine own.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I broke</LINE>
<LINE>my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for</LINE>
<LINE>coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the</LINE>
<LINE>kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her</LINE>
<LINE>pretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember the</LINE>
<LINE>wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took</LINE>
<LINE>two cods and, giving her them again, said with</LINE>
<LINE>weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are</LINE>
<LINE>true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is</LINE>
<LINE>mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>

<LINE>And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold</LINE>
<LINE>Can in this desert place buy entertainment,</LINE>
<LINE>Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:</LINE>
<LINE>Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd</LINE>
<LINE>And faints for succor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fair sir, I pity her</LINE>
<LINE>And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,</LINE>
<LINE>My fortunes were more able to relieve her;</LINE>
<LINE>But I am shepherd to another man</LINE>
<LINE>And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:</LINE>
<LINE>My master is of churlish disposition</LINE>
<LINE>And little recks to find the way to heaven</LINE>
<LINE>By doing deeds of hospitality:</LINE>
<LINE>Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed</LINE>
<LINE>Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,</LINE>
<LINE>By reason of his absence, there is nothing</LINE>
<LINE>That you will feed on; but what is, come see.</LINE>
<LINE>And in my voice most welcome shall you be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,</LINE>
<LINE>That little cares for buying any thing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And we will mend thy wages. I like this place.</LINE>
<LINE>And willingly could waste my time in it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Assuredly the thing is to be sold:</LINE>
<LINE>Go with me: if you like upon report</LINE>
<LINE>The soil, the profit and this kind of life,</LINE>

<LINE>And buy it with your gold right suddenly.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AMIENS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What you will, Monsieur Jaques.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me</LINE>
<LINE>nothing. Will you sing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AMIENS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>More at your request than to please myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you;</LINE>
<LINE>but that they call compliment is like the encounter</LINE>
<LINE>of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks me heartily,</LINE>
<LINE>methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me</LINE>
<LINE>the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will</LINE>
<LINE>not, hold your tongues.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AMIENS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the</LINE>
<LINE>duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all</LINE>
<LINE>this day to look you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is</LINE>
<LINE>too disputable for my company: I think of as many</LINE>
<LINE>matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no</LINE>
<LINE>boast of them. Come, warble, come.</LINE>
<SUBHEAD>SONG.</SUBHEAD>
<LINE>Who doth ambition shun</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>All together here</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And loves to live i' the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeking the food he eats</LINE>
<LINE>And pleased with what he gets,</LINE>
<LINE>Come hither, come hither, come hither:</LINE>
<LINE>Here shall he see No enemy</LINE>
<LINE>But winter and rough weather.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll give you a verse to this note that I made</LINE>
<LINE>yesterday in despite of my invention.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AMIENS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I'll sing it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus it goes:--</LINE>
<LINE>If it do come to pass</LINE>
<LINE>That any man turn ass,</LINE>
<LINE>Leaving his wealth and ease,</LINE>
<LINE>A stubborn will to please,</LINE>
<LINE>Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame:</LINE>
<LINE>Here shall he see</LINE>
<LINE>Gross fools as he,</LINE>
<LINE>An if he will come to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AMIENS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's that 'ducdame'?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a</LINE>
<LINE>circle. I'll go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'll</LINE>
<LINE>rail against all the first-born of Egypt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AMIENS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I'll go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ORLANDO and ADAM</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food!</LINE>
<LINE>Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell,</LINE>
<LINE>kind master.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Live</LINE>
<LINE>a little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little.</LINE>
<LINE>If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, I</LINE>
<LINE>will either be food for it or bring it for food to</LINE>
<LINE>thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.</LINE>
<LINE>For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at</LINE>
<LINE>the arm's end: I will here be with thee presently;</LINE>
<LINE>and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will</LINE>
<LINE>give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I</LINE>
<LINE>come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!</LINE>
<LINE>thou lookest cheerly, and I'll be with thee quickly.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bear</LINE>
<LINE>thee to some shelter; and thou shalt not die for</LINE>
<LINE>lack of a dinner, if there live any thing in this</LINE>
<LINE>desert. Cheerly, good Adam!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE VII.  The forest.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and
Lords like outlaws</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think he be transform'd into a beast;</LINE>
<LINE>For I can no where find him like a man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, he is but even now gone hence:</LINE>
<LINE>Here was he merry, hearing of a song.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he, compact of jars, grow musical,</LINE>
<LINE>We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter JAQUES</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He saves my labour by his own approach.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,</LINE>
<LINE>That your poor friends must woo your company?</LINE>
<LINE>What, you look merrily!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,</LINE>
<LINE>A motley fool; a miserable world!</LINE>
<LINE>As I do live by food, I met a fool</LINE>
<LINE>Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,</LINE>
<LINE>In good set terms and yet a motley fool.</LINE>
<LINE>'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,</LINE>
<LINE>'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'</LINE>
<LINE>And then he drew a dial from his poke,</LINE>
<LINE>And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:</LINE>
<LINE>Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,</LINE>
<LINE>And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;</LINE>
<LINE>And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,</LINE>
<LINE>And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;</LINE>
<LINE>And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear</LINE>
<LINE>The motley fool thus moral on the time,</LINE>
<LINE>My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,</LINE>
<LINE>That fools should be so deep-contemplative,</LINE>
<LINE>And I did laugh sans intermission</LINE>
<LINE>An hour by his dial. O noble fool!</LINE>
<LINE>A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What fool is this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,</LINE>
<LINE>And says, if ladies be but young and fair,</LINE>
<LINE>They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit</LINE>
<LINE>After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd</LINE>
<LINE>With observation, the which he vents</LINE>
<LINE>In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!</LINE>
<LINE>I am ambitious for a motley coat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou shalt have one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is my only suit;</LINE>
<LINE>Provided that you weed your better judgments</LINE>
<LINE>Of all opinion that grows rank in them</LINE>
<LINE>That I am wise. I must have liberty</LINE>
<LINE>Withal, as large a charter as the wind,</LINE>
<LINE>To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;</LINE>
<LINE>And they that are most galled with my folly,</LINE>
<LINE>They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?</LINE>
<LINE>The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:</LINE>
<LINE>He that a fool doth very wisely hit</LINE>
<LINE>Doth very foolishly, although he smart,</LINE>
<LINE>Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,</LINE>
<LINE>The wise man's folly is anatomized</LINE>
<LINE>Even by the squandering glances of the fool.</LINE>
<LINE>Invest me in my motley; give me leave</LINE>
<LINE>To speak my mind, and I will through and through</LINE>
<LINE>Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,</LINE>
<LINE>If they will patiently receive my medicine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, for a counter, would I do but good?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:</LINE>
<LINE>For thou thyself hast been a libertine,</LINE>
<LINE>As sensual as the brutish sting itself;</LINE>
<LINE>And all the embossed sores and headed evils,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,</LINE>
<LINE>Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, who cries out on pride,</LINE>
<LINE>That can therein tax any private party?</LINE>
<LINE>Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Till that the weary very means do ebb?</LINE>
<LINE>What woman in the city do I name,</LINE>
<LINE>When that I say the city-woman bears</LINE>
<LINE>The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?</LINE>
<LINE>Who can come in and say that I mean her,</LINE>
<LINE>When such a one as she such is her neighbour?</LINE>
<LINE>Or what is he of basest function</LINE>
<LINE>That says his bravery is not of my cost,</LINE>
<LINE>Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits</LINE>
<LINE>His folly to the mettle of my speech?</LINE>
<LINE>There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein</LINE>
<LINE>My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,</LINE>
<LINE>Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,</LINE>
<LINE>Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,</LINE>
<LINE>Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawn</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Forbear, and eat no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, I have eat none yet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of what kind should this cock come of?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else a rude despiser of good manners,</LINE>
<LINE>That in civility thou seem'st so empty?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point</LINE>
<LINE>Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show</LINE>
<LINE>Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred</LINE>
<LINE>And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:</LINE>
<LINE>He dies that touches any of this fruit</LINE>
<LINE>Till I and my affairs are answered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What would you have? Your gentleness shall force</LINE>
<LINE>More than your force move us to gentleness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I almost die for food; and let me have it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:</LINE>
<LINE>I thought that all things had been savage here;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore put I on the countenance</LINE>
<LINE>Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are</LINE>
<LINE>That in this desert inaccessible,</LINE>
<LINE>Under the shade of melancholy boughs,</LINE>
<LINE>Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time</LINE>
<LINE>If ever you have look'd on better days,</LINE>
<LINE>If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,</LINE>
<LINE>If ever sat at any good man's feast,</LINE>
<LINE>If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear</LINE>
<LINE>And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,</LINE>
<LINE>Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:</LINE>
<LINE>In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True is it that we have seen better days,</LINE>
<LINE>And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church</LINE>
<LINE>And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore sit you down in gentleness</LINE>
<LINE>And take upon command what help we have</LINE>
<LINE>That to your wanting may be minister'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then but forbear your food a little while,</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn</LINE>
<LINE>And give it food. There is an old poor man,</LINE>
<LINE>Who after me hath many a weary step</LINE>
<LINE>Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,</LINE>
<LINE>Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,</LINE>
<LINE>I will not touch a bit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go find him out,</LINE>
<LINE>And we will nothing waste till you return.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:</LINE>
<LINE>This wide and universal theatre</LINE>
<LINE>Presents more woeful pageants than the scene</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein we play in.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All the world's a stage,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the men and women merely players:</LINE>
<LINE>They have their exits and their entrances;</LINE>
<LINE>And one man in his time plays many parts,</LINE>
<LINE>His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,</LINE>
<LINE>Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.</LINE>
<LINE>And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel</LINE>
<LINE>And shining morning face, creeping like snail</LINE>
<LINE>Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,</LINE>
<LINE>Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad</LINE>
<LINE>Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,</LINE>
<LINE>Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,</LINE>
<LINE>Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeking the bubble reputation</LINE>
<LINE>Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,</LINE>
<LINE>In fair round belly with good capon lined,</LINE>
<LINE>With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,</LINE>
<LINE>Full of wise saws and modern instances;</LINE>
<LINE>And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts</LINE>
<LINE>Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,</LINE>
<LINE>With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,</LINE>
<LINE>His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide</LINE>
<LINE>For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,</LINE>
<LINE>Turning again toward childish treble, pipes</LINE>
<LINE>And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,</LINE>
<LINE>That ends this strange eventful history,</LINE>
<LINE>Is second childishness and mere oblivion,</LINE>
<LINE>Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter ORLANDO, with ADAM</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,</LINE>
<LINE>And let him feed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank you most for him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So had you need:</LINE>
<LINE>I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you</LINE>
<LINE>As yet, to question you about your fortunes.</LINE>
<LINE>Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SUBHEAD>SONG.</SUBHEAD>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AMIENS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Blow, blow, thou winter wind.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art not so unkind</LINE>
<LINE>As man's ingratitude;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy tooth is not so keen,</LINE>
<LINE>Because thou art not seen,</LINE>
<LINE>Although thy breath be rude.</LINE>
<LINE>Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:</LINE>
<LINE>Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:</LINE>
<LINE>Then, heigh-ho, the holly!</LINE>
<LINE>This life is most jolly.</LINE>
<LINE>Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,</LINE>
<LINE>That dost not bite so nigh</LINE>
<LINE>As benefits forgot:</LINE>
<LINE>Though thou the waters warp,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy sting is not so sharp</LINE>
<LINE>As friend remember'd not.</LINE>
<LINE>Heigh-ho! sing, c.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,</LINE>
<LINE>As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,</LINE>
<LINE>And as mine eye doth his effigies witness</LINE>
<LINE>Most truly limn'd and living in your face,</LINE>
<LINE>Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke</LINE>
<LINE>That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art right welcome as thy master is.</LINE>
<LINE>Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:</LINE>
<LINE>But were I not the better part made mercy,</LINE>
<LINE>I should not seek an absent argument</LINE>
<LINE>Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:</LINE>
<LINE>Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is;</LINE>
<LINE>Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living</LINE>
<LINE>Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more</LINE>
<LINE>To seek a living in our territory.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine</LINE>
<LINE>Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,</LINE>
<LINE>Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth</LINE>
<LINE>Of what we think against thee.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O that your highness knew my heart in this!</LINE>
<LINE>I never loved my brother in my life.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DUKE FREDERICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ORLANDO, with a paper</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:</LINE>
<LINE>And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey</LINE>
<LINE>With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.</LINE>
<LINE>O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books</LINE>
<LINE>And in their barks my thoughts I'll character;</LINE>
<LINE>That every eye which in this forest looks</LINE>
<LINE>Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.</LINE>
<LINE>Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree</LINE>
<LINE>The fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good</LINE>
<LINE>life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,</LINE>
<LINE>it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I</LINE>
<LINE>like it very well; but in respect that it is</LINE>
<LINE>private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it</LINE>
<LINE>is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in</LINE>
<LINE>respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As</LINE>
<LINE>is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;</LINE>
<LINE>but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much</LINE>
<LINE>against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more but that I know the more one sickens the</LINE>
<LINE>worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,</LINE>
<LINE>means and content is without three good friends;</LINE>
<LINE>that the property of rain is to wet and fire to</LINE>
<LINE>burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a</LINE>
<LINE>great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that</LINE>
<LINE>he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may</LINE>
<LINE>complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in</LINE>
<LINE>court, shepherd?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, truly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then thou art damned.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I hope.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all</LINE>
<LINE>on one side.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For not being at court? Your reason.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest</LINE>
<LINE>good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,</LINE>
<LINE>then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is</LINE>
<LINE>sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous</LINE>
<LINE>state, shepherd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners</LINE>
<LINE>at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the</LINE>
<LINE>behavior of the country is most mockable at the</LINE>
<LINE>court. You told me you salute not at the court, but</LINE>
<LINE>you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be</LINE>
<LINE>uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Instance, briefly; come, instance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their</LINE>
<LINE>fells, you know, are greasy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not</LINE>
<LINE>the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of</LINE>
<LINE>a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Besides, our hands are hard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.</LINE>
<LINE>A more sounder instance, come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And they are often tarred over with the surgery of</LINE>
<LINE>our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The</LINE>
<LINE>courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a</LINE>
<LINE>good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and</LINE>
<LINE>perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the</LINE>
<LINE>very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!</LINE>
<LINE>God make incision in thee! thou art raw.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get</LINE>
<LINE>that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's</LINE>
<LINE>happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my</LINE>
<LINE>harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes</LINE>
<LINE>graze and my lambs suck.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes</LINE>
<LINE>and the rams together and to offer to get your</LINE>
<LINE>living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a</LINE>
<LINE>bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a</LINE>
<LINE>twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,</LINE>
<LINE>out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not</LINE>
<LINE>damned for this, the devil himself will have no</LINE>
<LINE>shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst</LINE>
<LINE>'scape.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ROSALIND, with a paper, reading</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From the east to western Ind,</LINE>
<LINE>No jewel is like Rosalind.</LINE>
<LINE>Her worth, being mounted on the wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Through all the world bears Rosalind.</LINE>
<LINE>All the pictures fairest lined</LINE>
<LINE>Are but black to Rosalind.</LINE>
<LINE>Let no fair be kept in mind</LINE>
<LINE>But the fair of Rosalind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and</LINE>
<LINE>suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the</LINE>
<LINE>right butter-women's rank to market.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Out, fool!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For a taste:</LINE>
<LINE>If a hart do lack a hind,</LINE>
<LINE>Let him seek out Rosalind.</LINE>
<LINE>If the cat will after kind,</LINE>
<LINE>So be sure will Rosalind.</LINE>
<LINE>Winter garments must be lined,</LINE>
<LINE>So must slender Rosalind.</LINE>
<LINE>They that reap must sheaf and bind;</LINE>
<LINE>Then to cart with Rosalind.</LINE>
<LINE>Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,</LINE>
<LINE>Such a nut is Rosalind.</LINE>
<LINE>He that sweetest rose will find</LINE>
<LINE>Must find love's prick and Rosalind.</LINE>
<LINE>This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you</LINE>
<LINE>infect yourself with them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it</LINE>
<LINE>with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit</LINE>
<LINE>i' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half</LINE>
<LINE>ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the</LINE>
<LINE>forest judge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CELIA, with a writing</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR></LINE>
<LINE>Why should this a desert be?</LINE>
<LINE>For it is unpeopled? No:</LINE>
<LINE>Tongues I'll hang on every tree,</LINE>
<LINE>That shall civil sayings show:</LINE>
<LINE>Some, how brief the life of man</LINE>
<LINE>Runs his erring pilgrimage,</LINE>
<LINE>That the stretching of a span</LINE>
<LINE>Buckles in his sum of age;</LINE>
<LINE>Some, of violated vows</LINE>
<LINE>'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:</LINE>
<LINE>But upon the fairest boughs,</LINE>
<LINE>Or at every sentence end,</LINE>
<LINE>Will I Rosalinda write,</LINE>
<LINE>Teaching all that read to know</LINE>
<LINE>The quintessence of every sprite</LINE>
<LINE>Heaven would in little show.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore Heaven Nature charged</LINE>
<LINE>That one body should be fill'd</LINE>
<LINE>With all graces wide-enlarged:</LINE>
<LINE>Nature presently distill'd</LINE>
<LINE>Helen's cheek, but not her heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Cleopatra's majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Atalanta's better part,</LINE>
<LINE>Sad Lucretia's modesty.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus Rosalind of many parts</LINE>
<LINE>By heavenly synod was devised,</LINE>
<LINE>Of many faces, eyes and hearts,</LINE>
<LINE>To have the touches dearest prized.</LINE>
<LINE>Heaven would that she these gifts should have,</LINE>
<LINE>And I to live and die her slave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love</LINE>
<LINE>have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never</LINE>
<LINE>cried 'Have patience, good people!'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little.</LINE>
<LINE>Go with him, sirrah.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;</LINE>
<LINE>though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Didst thou hear these verses?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of</LINE>
<LINE>them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear</LINE>
<LINE>themselves without the verse and therefore stood</LINE>
<LINE>lamely in the verse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name</LINE>
<LINE>should be hanged and carved upon these trees?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder</LINE>
<LINE>before you came; for look here what I found on a</LINE>
<LINE>palm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since</LINE>
<LINE>Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which I</LINE>
<LINE>can hardly remember.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Trow you who hath done this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it a man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.</LINE>
<LINE>Change you colour?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prithee, who?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to</LINE>
<LINE>meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes</LINE>
<LINE>and so encounter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, but who is it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it possible?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,</LINE>
<LINE>tell me who it is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful</LINE>
<LINE>wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,</LINE>
<LINE>out of all hooping!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am</LINE>
<LINE>caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in</LINE>
<LINE>my disposition? One inch of delay more is a</LINE>
<LINE>South-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it</LINE>
<LINE>quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst</LINE>
<LINE>stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man</LINE>
<LINE>out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-</LINE>
<LINE>mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at</LINE>
<LINE>all. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that</LINE>
<LINE>may drink thy tidings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So you may put a man in your belly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is he of God's making? What manner of man? Is his</LINE>
<LINE>head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, he hath but a little beard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, God will send more, if the man will be</LINE>
<LINE>thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if</LINE>
<LINE>thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler's</LINE>
<LINE>heels and your heart both in an instant.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow and</LINE>
<LINE>true maid.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I' faith, coz, 'tis he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Orlando?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Orlando.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and</LINE>
<LINE>hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said</LINE>
<LINE>he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes</LINE>
<LINE>him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?</LINE>
<LINE>How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see</LINE>
<LINE>him again? Answer me in one word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a</LINE>
<LINE>word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To</LINE>
<LINE>say ay and no to these particulars is more than to</LINE>
<LINE>answer in a catechism.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But doth he know that I am in this forest and in</LINE>
<LINE>man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the</LINE>
<LINE>day he wrestled?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the</LINE>
<LINE>propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my</LINE>
<LINE>finding him, and relish it with good observance.</LINE>
<LINE>I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It may well be called Jove's tree, when it drops</LINE>
<LINE>forth such fruit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me audience, good madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Proceed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well</LINE>
<LINE>becomes the ground.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets</LINE>
<LINE>unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest</LINE>
<LINE>me out of tune.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you not know I am a woman? when I think, I must</LINE>
<LINE>speak. Sweet, say on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis he: slink by, and note him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had</LINE>
<LINE>as lief have been myself alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you</LINE>
<LINE>too for your society.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do desire we may be better strangers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, mar no more trees with writing</LINE>
<LINE>love-songs in their barks.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading</LINE>
<LINE>them ill-favouredly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Rosalind is your love's name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, just.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not like her name.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There was no thought of pleasing you when she was</LINE>
<LINE>christened.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What stature is she of?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Just as high as my heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been</LINE>
<LINE>acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned them</LINE>
<LINE>out of rings?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from</LINE>
<LINE>whence you have studied your questions.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of</LINE>
<LINE>Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and</LINE>
<LINE>we two will rail against our mistress the world and</LINE>
<LINE>all our misery.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will chide no breather in the world but myself,</LINE>
<LINE>against whom I know most faults.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The worst fault you have is to be in love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.</LINE>
<LINE>I am weary of you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found</LINE>
<LINE>you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you</LINE>
<LINE>shall see him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There I shall see mine own figure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur</LINE>
<LINE>Melancholy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit JAQUES</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to CELIA</STAGEDIR>  I will speak to him, like a saucy</LINE>
<LINE>lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.</LINE>
<LINE>Do you hear, forester?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very well: what would you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, what is't o'clock?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock</LINE>
<LINE>in the forest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then there is no true lover in the forest; else</LINE>
<LINE>sighing every minute and groaning every hour would</LINE>
<LINE>detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that</LINE>
<LINE>been as proper?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with</LINE>
<LINE>divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles</LINE>
<LINE>withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops</LINE>
<LINE>withal and who he stands still withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prithee, who doth he trot withal?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the</LINE>
<LINE>contract of her marriage and the day it is</LINE>
<LINE>solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,</LINE>
<LINE>Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of</LINE>
<LINE>seven year.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who ambles Time withal?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that</LINE>
<LINE>hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because</LINE>
<LINE>he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because</LINE>
<LINE>he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean</LINE>
<LINE>and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden</LINE>
<LINE>of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who doth he gallop withal?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as</LINE>
<LINE>softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who stays it still withal?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between</LINE>
<LINE>term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where dwell you, pretty youth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the</LINE>
<LINE>skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you native of this place?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your accent is something finer than you could</LINE>
<LINE>purchase in so removed a dwelling.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have been told so of many: but indeed an old</LINE>
<LINE>religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was</LINE>
<LINE>in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship</LINE>
<LINE>too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard</LINE>
<LINE>him read many lectures against it, and I thank God</LINE>
<LINE>I am not a woman, to be touched with so many</LINE>
<LINE>giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their</LINE>
<LINE>whole sex withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can you remember any of the principal evils that he</LINE>
<LINE>laid to the charge of women?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There were none principal; they were all like one</LINE>
<LINE>another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming</LINE>
<LINE>monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prithee, recount some of them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that</LINE>
<LINE>are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that</LINE>
<LINE>abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on</LINE>
<LINE>their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies</LINE>
<LINE>on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of</LINE>
<LINE>Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would</LINE>
<LINE>give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the</LINE>
<LINE>quotidian of love upon him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me</LINE>
<LINE>your remedy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he</LINE>
<LINE>taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage</LINE>
<LINE>of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What were his marks?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and</LINE>
<LINE>sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable</LINE>
<LINE>spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,</LINE>
<LINE>which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for</LINE>
<LINE>simply your having in beard is a younger brother's</LINE>
<LINE>revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your</LINE>
<LINE>bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe</LINE>
<LINE>untied and every thing about you demonstrating a</LINE>
<LINE>careless desolation; but you are no such man; you</LINE>
<LINE>are rather point-device in your accoutrements as</LINE>
<LINE>loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you</LINE>
<LINE>love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to</LINE>
<LINE>do than to confess she does: that is one of the</LINE>
<LINE>points in the which women still give the lie to</LINE>
<LINE>their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he</LINE>
<LINE>that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind</LINE>
<LINE>is so admired?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of</LINE>
<LINE>Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves</LINE>
<LINE>as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and</LINE>
<LINE>the reason why they are not so punished and cured</LINE>
<LINE>is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers</LINE>
<LINE>are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did you ever cure any so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me</LINE>
<LINE>his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to</LINE>
<LINE>woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish</LINE>
<LINE>youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing</LINE>
<LINE>and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,</LINE>
<LINE>inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every</LINE>
<LINE>passion something and for no passion truly any</LINE>
<LINE>thing, as boys and women are for the most part</LINE>
<LINE>cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe</LINE>
<LINE>him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep</LINE>
<LINE>for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor</LINE>
<LINE>from his mad humour of love to a living humour of</LINE>
<LINE>madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of</LINE>
<LINE>the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.</LINE>
<LINE>And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon</LINE>
<LINE>me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's</LINE>
<LINE>heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would not be cured, youth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind</LINE>
<LINE>and come every day to my cote and woo me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me</LINE>
<LINE>where it is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way</LINE>
<LINE>you shall tell me where in the forest you live.</LINE>
<LINE>Will you go?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With all my heart, good youth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your</LINE>
<LINE>goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?</LINE>
<LINE>doth my simple feature content you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most</LINE>
<LINE>capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove</LINE>
<LINE>in a thatched house!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a</LINE>
<LINE>man's good wit seconded with the forward child</LINE>
<LINE>Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a</LINE>
<LINE>great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would</LINE>
<LINE>the gods had made thee poetical.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in</LINE>
<LINE>deed and word? is it a true thing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most</LINE>
<LINE>feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what</LINE>
<LINE>they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art</LINE>
<LINE>honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some</LINE>
<LINE>hope thou didst feign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would you not have me honest?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for</LINE>
<LINE>honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  A material fool!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods</LINE>
<LINE>make me honest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut</LINE>
<LINE>were to put good meat into an unclean dish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!</LINE>
<LINE>sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may</LINE>
<LINE>be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been</LINE>
<LINE>with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next</LINE>
<LINE>village, who hath promised to meet me in this place</LINE>
<LINE>of the forest and to couple us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  I would fain see this meeting.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, the gods give us joy!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,</LINE>
<LINE>stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple</LINE>
<LINE>but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what</LINE>
<LINE>though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are</LINE>
<LINE>necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of</LINE>
<LINE>his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and</LINE>
<LINE>knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of</LINE>
<LINE>his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?</LINE>
<LINE>Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer</LINE>
<LINE>hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man</LINE>
<LINE>therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more</LINE>
<LINE>worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a</LINE>
<LINE>married man more honourable than the bare brow of a</LINE>
<LINE>bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no</LINE>
<LINE>skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to</LINE>
<LINE>want. Here comes Sir Oliver.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you</LINE>
<LINE>dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go</LINE>
<LINE>with you to your chapel?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is there none here to give the woman?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not take her on gift of any man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Advancing</STAGEDIR></LINE>
<LINE>Proceed, proceed I'll give her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,</LINE>
<LINE>sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your</LINE>
<LINE>last company: I am very glad to see you: even a</LINE>
<LINE>toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you be married, motley?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and</LINE>
<LINE>the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and</LINE>
<LINE>as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And will you, being a man of your breeding, be</LINE>
<LINE>married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to</LINE>
<LINE>church, and have a good priest that can tell you</LINE>
<LINE>what marriage is: this fellow will but join you</LINE>
<LINE>together as they join wainscot; then one of you will</LINE>
<LINE>prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  I am not in the mind but I were better to be</LINE>
<LINE>married of him than of another: for he is not like</LINE>
<LINE>to marry me well; and not being well married, it</LINE>
<LINE>will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Come, sweet Audrey:</LINE>
<LINE>We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,--</LINE>
<LINE>O sweet Oliver,</LINE>
<LINE>O brave Oliver,</LINE>
<LINE>Leave me not behind thee: but,--</LINE>
<LINE>Wind away,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ROSALIND and CELIA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never talk to me; I will weep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider</LINE>
<LINE>that tears do not become a man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But have I not cause to weep?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His very hair is of the dissembling colour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are</LINE>
<LINE>Judas's own children.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch</LINE>
<LINE>of holy bread.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun</LINE>
<LINE>of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;</LINE>
<LINE>the very ice of chastity is in them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But why did he swear he would come this morning, and</LINE>
<LINE>comes not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you think so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a</LINE>
<LINE>horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do</LINE>
<LINE>think him as concave as a covered goblet or a</LINE>
<LINE>worm-eaten nut.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not true in love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have heard him swear downright he was.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is</LINE>
<LINE>no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are</LINE>
<LINE>both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends</LINE>
<LINE>here in the forest on the duke your father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I met the duke yesterday and had much question with</LINE>
<LINE>him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told</LINE>
<LINE>him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.</LINE>
<LINE>But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a</LINE>
<LINE>man as Orlando?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,</LINE>
<LINE>speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks</LINE>
<LINE>them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of</LINE>
<LINE>his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse</LINE>
<LINE>but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble</LINE>
<LINE>goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly</LINE>
<LINE>guides. Who comes here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CORIN</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistress and master, you have oft inquired</LINE>
<LINE>After the shepherd that complain'd of love,</LINE>
<LINE>Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,</LINE>
<LINE>Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess</LINE>
<LINE>That was his mistress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, and what of him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you will see a pageant truly play'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Between the pale complexion of true love</LINE>
<LINE>And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,</LINE>
<LINE>Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,</LINE>
<LINE>If you will mark it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, come, let us remove:</LINE>
<LINE>The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.</LINE>
<LINE>Bring us to this sight, and you shall say</LINE>
<LINE>I'll prove a busy actor in their play.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;</LINE>
<LINE>Say that you love me not, but say not so</LINE>
<LINE>In bitterness. The common executioner,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,</LINE>
<LINE>Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck</LINE>
<LINE>But first begs pardon: will you sterner be</LINE>
<LINE>Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behind</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would not be thy executioner:</LINE>
<LINE>I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,</LINE>
<LINE>That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,</LINE>
<LINE>Who shut their coward gates on atomies,</LINE>
<LINE>Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!</LINE>
<LINE>Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;</LINE>
<LINE>And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:</LINE>
<LINE>Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;</LINE>
<LINE>Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,</LINE>
<LINE>Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!</LINE>
<LINE>Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:</LINE>
<LINE>Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains</LINE>
<LINE>Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,</LINE>
<LINE>The cicatrice and capable impressure</LINE>
<LINE>Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes</LINE>
<LINE>That can do hurt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O dear Phebe,</LINE>
<LINE>If ever,--as that ever may be near,--</LINE>
<LINE>You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,</LINE>
<LINE>Then shall you know the wounds invisible</LINE>
<LINE>That love's keen arrows make.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But till that time</LINE>
<LINE>Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,</LINE>
<LINE>Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;</LINE>
<LINE>As till that time I shall not pity thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,</LINE>
<LINE>That you insult, exult, and all at once,</LINE>
<LINE>Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--</LINE>
<LINE>As, by my faith, I see no more in you</LINE>
<LINE>Than without candle may go dark to bed--</LINE>
<LINE>Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?</LINE>
<LINE>I see no more in you than in the ordinary</LINE>
<LINE>Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,</LINE>
<LINE>I think she means to tangle my eyes too!</LINE>
<LINE>No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,</LINE>
<LINE>Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,</LINE>
<LINE>That can entame my spirits to your worship.</LINE>
<LINE>You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,</LINE>
<LINE>Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?</LINE>
<LINE>You are a thousand times a properer man</LINE>
<LINE>Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you</LINE>
<LINE>That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;</LINE>
<LINE>And out of you she sees herself more proper</LINE>
<LINE>Than any of her lineaments can show her.</LINE>
<LINE>But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,</LINE>
<LINE>And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:</LINE>
<LINE>For I must tell you friendly in your ear,</LINE>
<LINE>Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:</LINE>
<LINE>Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:</LINE>
<LINE>Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.</LINE>
<LINE>So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:</LINE>
<LINE>I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll</LINE>
<LINE>fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as</LINE>
<LINE>she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her</LINE>
<LINE>with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For no ill will I bear you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, do not fall in love with me,</LINE>
<LINE>For I am falser than vows made in wine:</LINE>
<LINE>Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.</LINE>
<LINE>Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,</LINE>
<LINE>And be not proud: though all the world could see,</LINE>
<LINE>None could be so abused in sight as he.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, to our flock.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,</LINE>
<LINE>'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet Phebe,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet Phebe, pity me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherever sorrow is, relief would be:</LINE>
<LINE>If you do sorrow at my grief in love,</LINE>
<LINE>By giving love your sorrow and my grief</LINE>
<LINE>Were both extermined.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would have you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, that were covetousness.</LINE>
<LINE>Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet it is not that I bear thee love;</LINE>
<LINE>But since that thou canst talk of love so well,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,</LINE>
<LINE>I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:</LINE>
<LINE>But do not look for further recompense</LINE>
<LINE>Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So holy and so perfect is my love,</LINE>
<LINE>And I in such a poverty of grace,</LINE>
<LINE>That I shall think it a most plenteous crop</LINE>
<LINE>To glean the broken ears after the man</LINE>
<LINE>That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then</LINE>
<LINE>A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not very well, but I have met him oft;</LINE>
<LINE>And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds</LINE>
<LINE>That the old carlot once was master of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Think not I love him, though I ask for him:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;</LINE>
<LINE>But what care I for words? yet words do well</LINE>
<LINE>When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.</LINE>
<LINE>It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:</LINE>
<LINE>But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:</LINE>
<LINE>He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him</LINE>
<LINE>Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Did make offence his eye did heal it up.</LINE>
<LINE>He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:</LINE>
<LINE>His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:</LINE>
<LINE>There was a pretty redness in his lip,</LINE>
<LINE>A little riper and more lusty red</LINE>
<LINE>Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference</LINE>
<LINE>Between the constant red and mingled damask.</LINE>
<LINE>There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him</LINE>
<LINE>In parcels as I did, would have gone near</LINE>
<LINE>To fall in love with him; but, for my part,</LINE>
<LINE>I love him not nor hate him not; and yet</LINE>
<LINE>I have more cause to hate him than to love him:</LINE>
<LINE>For what had he to do to chide at me?</LINE>
<LINE>He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:</LINE>
<LINE>And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:</LINE>
<LINE>I marvel why I answer'd not again:</LINE>
<LINE>But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll write to him a very taunting letter,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Phebe, with all my heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll write it straight;</LINE>
<LINE>The matter's in my head and in my heart:</LINE>
<LINE>I will be bitter with him and passing short.</LINE>
<LINE>Go with me, Silvius.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted</LINE>
<LINE>with thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They say you are a melancholy fellow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am so; I do love it better than laughing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Those that are in extremity of either are abominable</LINE>
<LINE>fellows and betray themselves to every modern</LINE>
<LINE>censure worse than drunkards.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then, 'tis good to be a post.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is</LINE>
<LINE>emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,</LINE>
<LINE>nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the</LINE>
<LINE>soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,</LINE>
<LINE>which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor</LINE>
<LINE>the lover's, which is all these: but it is a</LINE>
<LINE>melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,</LINE>
<LINE>extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's</LINE>
<LINE>contemplation of my travels, in which my often</LINE>
<LINE>rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to</LINE>
<LINE>be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see</LINE>
<LINE>other men's; then, to have seen much and to have</LINE>
<LINE>nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, I have gained my experience.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have</LINE>
<LINE>a fool to make me merry than experience to make me</LINE>
<LINE>sad; and to travel for it too!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ORLANDO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and</LINE>
<LINE>wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your</LINE>
<LINE>own country, be out of love with your nativity and</LINE>
<LINE>almost chide God for making you that countenance you</LINE>
<LINE>are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a</LINE>
<LINE>gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been</LINE>
<LINE>all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such</LINE>
<LINE>another trick, never come in my sight more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Break an hour's promise in love! He that will</LINE>
<LINE>divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but</LINE>
<LINE>a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the</LINE>
<LINE>affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid</LINE>
<LINE>hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant</LINE>
<LINE>him heart-whole.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon me, dear Rosalind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I</LINE>
<LINE>had as lief be wooed of a snail.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of a snail?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he</LINE>
<LINE>carries his house on his head; a better jointure,</LINE>
<LINE>I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings</LINE>
<LINE>his destiny with him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be</LINE>
<LINE>beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in</LINE>
<LINE>his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I am your Rosalind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a</LINE>
<LINE>Rosalind of a better leer than you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday</LINE>
<LINE>humour and like enough to consent. What would you</LINE>
<LINE>say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would kiss before I spoke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were</LINE>
<LINE>gravelled for lack of matter, you might take</LINE>
<LINE>occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are</LINE>
<LINE>out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--God</LINE>
<LINE>warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How if the kiss be denied?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or</LINE>
<LINE>I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, of my suit?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.</LINE>
<LINE>Am not I your Rosalind?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I take some joy to say you are, because I would be</LINE>
<LINE>talking of her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well in her person I say I will not have you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then in mine own person I die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is</LINE>
<LINE>almost six thousand years old, and in all this time</LINE>
<LINE>there was not any man died in his own person,</LINE>
<LINE>videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains</LINE>
<LINE>dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he</LINE>
<LINE>could to die before, and he is one of the patterns</LINE>
<LINE>of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair</LINE>
<LINE>year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been</LINE>
<LINE>for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went</LINE>
<LINE>but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being</LINE>
<LINE>taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish</LINE>
<LINE>coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'</LINE>
<LINE>But these are all lies: men have died from time to</LINE>
<LINE>time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,</LINE>
<LINE>for, I protest, her frown might kill me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now</LINE>
<LINE>I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on</LINE>
<LINE>disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant</LINE>
<LINE>it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then love me, Rosalind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And wilt thou have me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and twenty such.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What sayest thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you not good?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hope so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?</LINE>
<LINE>Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray thee, marry us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot say the words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but when?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why now; as fast as she can marry us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I might ask you for your commission; but I do take</LINE>
<LINE>thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes</LINE>
<LINE>before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought</LINE>
<LINE>runs before her actions.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So do all thoughts; they are winged.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now tell me how long you would have her after you</LINE>
<LINE>have possessed her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For ever and a day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;</LINE>
<LINE>men are April when they woo, December when they wed:</LINE>
<LINE>maids are May when they are maids, but the sky</LINE>
<LINE>changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous</LINE>
<LINE>of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,</LINE>
<LINE>more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more</LINE>
<LINE>new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires</LINE>
<LINE>than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana</LINE>
<LINE>in the fountain, and I will do that when you are</LINE>
<LINE>disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and</LINE>
<LINE>that when thou art inclined to sleep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But will my Rosalind do so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my life, she will do as I do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, but she is wise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the</LINE>
<LINE>wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's</LINE>
<LINE>wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and</LINE>
<LINE>'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly</LINE>
<LINE>with the smoke out at the chimney.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say</LINE>
<LINE>'Wit, whither wilt?'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met</LINE>
<LINE>your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And what wit could wit have to excuse that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall</LINE>
<LINE>never take her without her answer, unless you take</LINE>
<LINE>her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot</LINE>
<LINE>make her fault her husband's occasion, let her</LINE>
<LINE>never nurse her child herself, for she will breed</LINE>
<LINE>it like a fool!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I</LINE>
<LINE>will be with thee again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you</LINE>
<LINE>would prove: my friends told me as much, and I</LINE>
<LINE>thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours</LINE>
<LINE>won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,</LINE>
<LINE>death! Two o'clock is your hour?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sweet Rosalind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend</LINE>
<LINE>me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,</LINE>
<LINE>if you break one jot of your promise or come one</LINE>
<LINE>minute behind your hour, I will think you the most</LINE>
<LINE>pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover</LINE>
<LINE>and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that</LINE>
<LINE>may be chosen out of the gross band of the</LINE>
<LINE>unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep</LINE>
<LINE>your promise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my</LINE>
<LINE>Rosalind: so adieu.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such</LINE>
<LINE>offenders, and let Time try: adieu.</LINE>

<LINE>You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou</LINE>
<LINE>didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But</LINE>
<LINE>it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown</LINE>
<LINE>bottom, like the bay of Portugal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour</LINE>
<LINE>affection in, it runs out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot</LINE>
<LINE>of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,</LINE>
<LINE>that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes</LINE>
<LINE>because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I</LINE>
<LINE>am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter SILVIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My errand is to you, fair youth;</LINE>
<LINE>My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:</LINE>
<LINE>I know not the contents; but, as I guess</LINE>
<LINE>By the stern brow and waspish action</LINE>
<LINE>Which she did use as she was writing of it,</LINE>
<LINE>It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:</LINE>
<LINE>I am but as a guiltless messenger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Patience herself would startle at this letter</LINE>
<LINE>And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:</LINE>
<LINE>She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;</LINE>
<LINE>She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,</LINE>
<LINE>Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!</LINE>
<LINE>Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:</LINE>
<LINE>Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,</LINE>
<LINE>This is a letter of your own device.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, I protest, I know not the contents:</LINE>
<LINE>Phebe did write it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, you are a fool</LINE>
<LINE>And turn'd into the extremity of love.</LINE>
<LINE>I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.</LINE>
<LINE>A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think</LINE>
<LINE>That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:</LINE>
<LINE>She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:</LINE>
<LINE>I say she never did invent this letter;</LINE>
<LINE>This is a man's invention and his hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sure, it is hers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.</LINE>
<LINE>A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,</LINE>
<LINE>Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain</LINE>
<LINE>Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention</LINE>
<LINE>Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect</LINE>
<LINE>Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SILVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So please you, for I never heard it yet;</LINE>

<LINE>Why, thy godhead laid apart,</LINE>
<LINE>Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?</LINE>
<LINE>Did you ever hear such railing?</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles the eye of man did woo me,</LINE>
<LINE>That could do no vengeance to me.</LINE>
<LINE>Meaning me a beast.</LINE>
<LINE>If the scorn of your bright eyne</LINE>
<LINE>Have power to raise such love in mine,</LINE>
<LINE>Alack, in me what strange effect</LINE>
<LINE>Would they work in mild aspect!</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles you chid me, I did love;</LINE>
<LINE>How then might your prayers move!</LINE>
<LINE>He that brings this love to thee</LINE>
<LINE>Little knows this love in me:</LINE>
<LINE>And by him seal up thy mind;</LINE>
<LINE>Whether that thy youth and kind</LINE>
<LINE>Will the faithful offer take</LINE>

<LINE>Or else by him my love deny,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, poor shepherd!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt</LINE>
<LINE>thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an</LINE>
<LINE>instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to</LINE>
<LINE>be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see</LINE>
<LINE>love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to</LINE>
<LINE>her: that if she love me, I charge her to love</LINE>
<LINE>thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless</LINE>
<LINE>thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,</LINE>
<LINE>hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit SILVIUS</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter OLIVER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,</LINE>
<LINE>Where in the purlieus of this forest stands</LINE>
<LINE>A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:</LINE>
<LINE>The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream</LINE>
<LINE>Left on your right hand brings you to the place.</LINE>
<LINE>But at this hour the house doth keep itself;</LINE>
<LINE>There's none within.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If that an eye may profit by a tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>Then should I know you by description;</LINE>
<LINE>Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,</LINE>
<LINE>Of female favour, and bestows himself</LINE>
<LINE>Like a ripe sister: the woman low</LINE>
<LINE>And browner than her brother.' Are not you</LINE>
<LINE>The owner of the house I did inquire for?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Orlando doth commend him to you both,</LINE>
<LINE>And to that youth he calls his Rosalind</LINE>
<LINE>He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am: what must we understand by this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Some of my shame; if you will know of me</LINE>
<LINE>What man I am, and how, and why, and where</LINE>
<LINE>This handkercher was stain'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, tell it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When last the young Orlando parted from you</LINE>
<LINE>He left a promise to return again</LINE>
<LINE>Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,</LINE>
<LINE>Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,</LINE>
<LINE>Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,</LINE>
<LINE>And mark what object did present itself:</LINE>
<LINE>Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age</LINE>
<LINE>And high top bald with dry antiquity,</LINE>
<LINE>A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,</LINE>
<LINE>Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck</LINE>
<LINE>A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,</LINE>
<LINE>Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd</LINE>
<LINE>The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,</LINE>
<LINE>And with indented glides did slip away</LINE>
<LINE>Into a bush: under which bush's shade</LINE>
<LINE>A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,</LINE>
<LINE>Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,</LINE>
<LINE>When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis</LINE>
<LINE>The royal disposition of that beast</LINE>
<LINE>To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:</LINE>
<LINE>This seen, Orlando did approach the man</LINE>
<LINE>And found it was his brother, his elder brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;</LINE>
<LINE>And he did render him the most unnatural</LINE>
<LINE>That lived amongst men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And well he might so do,</LINE>
<LINE>For well I know he was unnatural.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,</LINE>
<LINE>Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;</LINE>
<LINE>But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,</LINE>
<LINE>And nature, stronger than his just occasion,</LINE>
<LINE>Made him give battle to the lioness,</LINE>
<LINE>Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling</LINE>
<LINE>From miserable slumber I awaked.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you his brother?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wast you he rescued?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Twas I; but 'tis not I I do not shame</LINE>
<LINE>To tell you what I was, since my conversion</LINE>
<LINE>So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, for the bloody napkin?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By and by.</LINE>
<LINE>When from the first to last betwixt us two</LINE>
<LINE>Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,</LINE>
<LINE>As how I came into that desert place:--</LINE>
<LINE>In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,</LINE>
<LINE>Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,</LINE>
<LINE>Committing me unto my brother's love;</LINE>
<LINE>Who led me instantly unto his cave,</LINE>
<LINE>There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm</LINE>
<LINE>The lioness had torn some flesh away,</LINE>
<LINE>Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted</LINE>
<LINE>And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.</LINE>
<LINE>Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;</LINE>
<LINE>And, after some small space, being strong at heart,</LINE>
<LINE>He sent me hither, stranger as I am,</LINE>
<LINE>To tell this story, that you might excuse</LINE>
<LINE>His broken promise, and to give this napkin</LINE>
<LINE>Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth</LINE>
<LINE>That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>ROSALIND swoons</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Many will swoon when they do look on blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Look, he recovers.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would I were at home.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We'll lead you thither.</LINE>
<LINE>I pray you, will you take him by the arm?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be of good cheer, youth: you a man! you lack a</LINE>
<LINE>man's heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would</LINE>
<LINE>think this was well counterfeited! I pray you, tell</LINE>
<LINE>your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This was not counterfeit: there is too great</LINE>
<LINE>testimony in your complexion that it was a passion</LINE>
<LINE>of earnest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Counterfeit, I assure you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So I do: but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by right.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, you look paler and paler: pray you, draw</LINE>
<LINE>homewards. Good sir, go with us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That will I, for I must bear answer back</LINE>
<LINE>How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall devise something: but, I pray you, commend</LINE>

<LINE>Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying,</LINE>
<LINE>'The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man</LINE>
<LINE>knows himself to be a fool.' The heathen</LINE>
<LINE>philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,</LINE>
<LINE>would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;</LINE>
<LINE>meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and</LINE>
<LINE>lips to open. You do love this maid?</LINE>

<LINE>No, sir.</LINE>

<LINE>is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out</LINE>

<LINE>thee away, translate thy life into death, thy</LINE>
<LINE>liberty into bondage: I will deal in poison with</LINE>
<LINE>thee, or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLIVER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the</LINE>

<LINE>I love Aliena; say with her that she loves me;</LINE>
<LINE>consent with both that we may enjoy each other: it</LINE>

<LINE>O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is my arm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws</LINE>
<LINE>of a lion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to</LINE>
<LINE>swoon when he showed me your handkerchief?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and greater wonders than that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, I know where you are: nay, 'tis true: there was</LINE>
<LINE>never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams</LINE>
<LINE>and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and</LINE>
<LINE>overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner</LINE>
<LINE>met but they looked, no sooner looked but they</LINE>
<LINE>loved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no sooner</LINE>
<LINE>sighed but they asked one another the reason, no</LINE>
<LINE>sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;</LINE>
<LINE>and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs</LINE>
<LINE>to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or</LINE>
<LINE>else be incontinent before marriage: they are in</LINE>
<LINE>the very wrath of love and they will together; clubs</LINE>
<LINE>cannot part them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They shall be married to-morrow, and I will bid the</LINE>
<LINE>duke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it</LINE>
<LINE>is to look into happiness through another man's</LINE>
<LINE>eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at</LINE>
<LINE>the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall</LINE>
<LINE>think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I can live no longer by thinking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.</LINE>
<LINE>Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,</LINE>
<LINE>that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I</LINE>
<LINE>speak not this that you should bear a good opinion</LINE>
<LINE>of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;</LINE>
<LINE>neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in</LINE>
<LINE>some little measure draw a belief from you, to do</LINE>
<LINE>yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if</LINE>
<LINE>you please, that I can do strange things: I have,</LINE>
<LINE>since I was three year old, conversed with a</LINE>
<LINE>magician, most profound in his art and yet not</LINE>
<LINE>damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart</LINE>
<LINE>as your gesture cries it out, when your brother</LINE>
<LINE>marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into</LINE>
<LINE>what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is</LINE>
<LINE>not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient</LINE>
<LINE>to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human</LINE>
<LINE>as she is and without any danger.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is</LINE>
<LINE>no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter two Pages</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Page</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well met, honest gentleman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and a song.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Page</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are for you: sit i' the middle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Page</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking or</LINE>
<LINE>spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only</LINE>
<LINE>prologues to a bad voice?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Page</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two</LINE>
<LINE>gipsies on a horse.</LINE>
<SUBHEAD>SONG.</SUBHEAD>
<LINE>It was a lover and his lass,</LINE>
<LINE>With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,</LINE>
<LINE>That o'er the green corn-field did pass</LINE>
<LINE>In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,</LINE>
<LINE>When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding:</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet lovers love the spring.</LINE>
<LINE>Between the acres of the rye,</LINE>
<LINE>With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino</LINE>
<LINE>These pretty country folks would lie,</LINE>
<LINE>In spring time, c.</LINE>
<LINE>This carol they began that hour,</LINE>
<LINE>With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,</LINE>
<LINE>How that a life was but a flower</LINE>
<LINE>In spring time, c.</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore take the present time,</LINE>
<LINE>With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino;</LINE>
<LINE>For love is crowned with the prime</LINE>
<LINE>In spring time, c.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great</LINE>
<LINE>matter in the ditty, yet the note was very</LINE>
<LINE>untuneable.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Page</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are deceived, sir: we kept time, we lost not our time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy</LINE>
<LINE>Can do all this that he hath promised?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I sometimes do believe, and sometimes do not;</LINE>
<LINE>As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Patience once more, whiles our compact is urged:</LINE>
<LINE>You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,</LINE>
<LINE>You will bestow her on Orlando here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But if you do refuse to marry me,</LINE>
<LINE>You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHEBE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So is the bargain.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You say, that you'll have Phebe, if she will?</LINE>

<LINE>Though to have her and death were both one thing.</LINE>

<LINE>I have promised to make all this matter even.</LINE>
<LINE>Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter;</LINE>
<LINE>You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter:</LINE>
<LINE>Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else refusing me, to wed this shepherd:</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do remember in this shepherd boy</LINE>
<LINE>Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLANDO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, the first time that I ever saw him</LINE>
<LINE>Methought he was a brother to your daughter:</LINE>
<LINE>But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,</LINE>
<LINE>And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments</LINE>
<LINE>Of many desperate studies by his uncle,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom he reports to be a great magician,</LINE>
<LINE>Obscured in the circle of this forest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is, sure, another flood toward, and these</LINE>
<LINE>couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of</LINE>
<LINE>very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Salutation and greeting to you all!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my lord, bid him welcome: this is the</LINE>
<LINE>motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in</LINE>
<LINE>the forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If any man doubt that, let him put me to my</LINE>
<LINE>purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered</LINE>
<LINE>a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth</LINE>
<LINE>with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have</LINE>
<LINE>had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And how was that ta'en up?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the</LINE>
<LINE>seventh cause.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I like him very well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I</LINE>
<LINE>press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country</LINE>
<LINE>copulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as</LINE>
<LINE>marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,</LINE>
<LINE>sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor</LINE>
<LINE>humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else</LINE>
<LINE>will: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a</LINE>
<LINE>poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, for the seventh cause; how did you find the</LINE>
<LINE>quarrel on the seventh cause?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more</LINE>
<LINE>seeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike the</LINE>
<LINE>cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,</LINE>
<LINE>if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the</LINE>
<LINE>mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.</LINE>
<LINE>If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he</LINE>
<LINE>would send me word, he cut it to please himself:</LINE>
<LINE>this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was</LINE>
<LINE>not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is</LINE>
<LINE>called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not</LINE>
<LINE>well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this</LINE>
<LINE>is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not</LINE>
<LINE>well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the</LINE>
<LINE>Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie</LINE>
<LINE>Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,</LINE>
<LINE>nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we</LINE>
<LINE>measured swords and parted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TOUCHSTONE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have</LINE>
<LINE>books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.</LINE>
<LINE>The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the</LINE>
<LINE>Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the</LINE>
<LINE>fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the</LINE>
<LINE>Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with</LINE>
<LINE>Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All</LINE>
<LINE>these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may</LINE>
<LINE>avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven</LINE>
<LINE>justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the</LINE>
<LINE>parties were met themselves, one of them thought but</LINE>
<LINE>of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and</LINE>
<LINE>they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the</LINE>
<LINE>only peacemaker; much virtue in If.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at</LINE>
<LINE>any thing and yet a fool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under</LINE>
<LINE>the presentation of that he shoots his wit.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES DE BOYS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me have audience for a word or two:</LINE>
<LINE>I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,</LINE>
<LINE>That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.</LINE>
<LINE>Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day</LINE>
<LINE>Men of great worth resorted to this forest,</LINE>
<LINE>Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,</LINE>
<LINE>In his own conduct, purposely to take</LINE>
<LINE>His brother here and put him to the sword:</LINE>
<LINE>And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;</LINE>
<LINE>Where meeting with an old religious man,</LINE>
<LINE>After some question with him, was converted</LINE>
<LINE>Both from his enterprise and from the world,</LINE>
<LINE>His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,</LINE>
<LINE>And all their lands restored to them again</LINE>
<LINE>That were with him exiled. This to be true,</LINE>
<LINE>I do engage my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SENIOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome, young man;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:</LINE>
<LINE>To one his lands withheld, and to the other</LINE>
<LINE>A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.</LINE>
<LINE>First, in this forest, let us do those ends</LINE>
<LINE>That here were well begun and well begot:</LINE>
<LINE>And after, every of this happy number</LINE>
<LINE>That have endured shrewd days and nights with us</LINE>
<LINE>Shall share the good of our returned fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>According to the measure of their states.</LINE>
<LINE>Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity</LINE>
<LINE>And fall into our rustic revelry.</LINE>
<LINE>Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,</LINE>
<LINE>With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,</LINE>
<LINE>The duke hath put on a religious life</LINE>
<LINE>And thrown into neglect the pompous court?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES DE BOYS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAQUES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To him will I : out of these convertites</LINE>
<LINE>There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To DUKE SENIOR</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>You to your former honour I bequeath;</LINE>
<LINE>Your patience and your virtue well deserves it:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To ORLANDO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>You to a love that your true faith doth merit:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To OLIVER</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>You to your land and love and great allies:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To SILVIUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>You to a long and well-deserved bed:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To TOUCHSTONE</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage</LINE>
<LINE>Is but for two months victuall'd. So, to your pleasures:</LINE>
<LINE>I am for other than for dancing measures.</LINE>

<EPILOGUE><TITLE>EPILOGUE</TITLE>
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSALIND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;</LINE>
<LINE>but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord</LINE>
<LINE>the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs</LINE>
<LINE>no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no</LINE>
<LINE>epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,</LINE>
<LINE>and good plays prove the better by the help of good</LINE>
<LINE>epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am</LINE>
<LINE>neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with</LINE>
<LINE>you in the behalf of a good play! I am not</LINE>
<LINE>furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not</LINE>
<LINE>become me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll begin</LINE>
<LINE>with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love</LINE>
<LINE>you bear to men, to like as much of this play as</LINE>
<LINE>please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love</LINE>
<LINE>you bear to women--as I perceive by your simpering,</LINE>
<LINE>none of you hates them--that between you and the</LINE>
<LINE>women the play may please. If I were a woman I</LINE>
<LINE>would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased</LINE>
<LINE>me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I</LINE>
<LINE>defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good</LINE>
<LINE>beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my</LINE>
<LINE>kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEGEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall</LINE>
<LINE>And by the doom of death end woes and all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;</LINE>
<LINE>I am not partial to infringe our laws:</LINE>
<LINE>The enmity and discord which of late</LINE>
<LINE>Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke</LINE>
<LINE>To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,</LINE>
<LINE>Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives</LINE>
<LINE>Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,</LINE>
<LINE>Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.</LINE>
<LINE>For, since the mortal and intestine jars</LINE>
<LINE>'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,</LINE>
<LINE>It hath in solemn synods been decreed</LINE>
<LINE>Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,</LINE>
<LINE>To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,</LINE>
<LINE>If any born at Ephesus be seen</LINE>
<LINE>At any Syracusian marts and fairs;</LINE>
<LINE>Again: if any Syracusian born</LINE>
<LINE>Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,</LINE>
<LINE>His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless a thousand marks be levied,</LINE>
<LINE>To quit the penalty and to ransom him.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEGEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,</LINE>
<LINE>My woes end likewise with the evening sun.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause</LINE>
<LINE>Why thou departed'st from thy native home</LINE>
<LINE>And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEGEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A heavier task could not have been imposed</LINE>
<LINE>Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, that the world may witness that my end</LINE>
<LINE>Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.</LINE>
<LINE>In Syracusa was I born, and wed</LINE>
<LINE>Unto a woman, happy but for me,</LINE>
<LINE>And by me, had not our hap been bad.</LINE>
<LINE>With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased</LINE>
<LINE>By prosperous voyages I often made</LINE>
<LINE>To Epidamnum; till my factor's death</LINE>
<LINE>And the great care of goods at random left</LINE>
<LINE>Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:</LINE>
<LINE>From whom my absence was not six months old</LINE>
<LINE>Before herself, almost at fainting under</LINE>
<LINE>The pleasing punishment that women bear,</LINE>
<LINE>Had made provision for her following me</LINE>
<LINE>And soon and safe arrived where I was.</LINE>
<LINE>There had she not been long, but she became</LINE>
<LINE>A joyful mother of two goodly sons;</LINE>
<LINE>And, which was strange, the one so like the other,</LINE>
<LINE>As could not be distinguish'd but by names.</LINE>
<LINE>That very hour, and in the self-same inn,</LINE>
<LINE>A meaner woman was delivered</LINE>
<LINE>Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:</LINE>
<LINE>Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--</LINE>
<LINE>I bought and brought up to attend my sons.</LINE>
<LINE>My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</LINE>
<LINE>Made daily motions for our home return:</LINE>
<LINE>Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,</LINE>
<LINE>We came aboard.</LINE>
<LINE>A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Before the always wind-obeying deep</LINE>
<LINE>Gave any tragic instance of our harm:</LINE>
<LINE>But longer did we not retain much hope;</LINE>
<LINE>For what obscured light the heavens did grant</LINE>
<LINE>Did but convey unto our fearful minds</LINE>
<LINE>A doubtful warrant of immediate death;</LINE>
<LINE>Which though myself would gladly have embraced,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</LINE>
<LINE>Weeping before for what she saw must come,</LINE>
<LINE>And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</LINE>
<LINE>That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</LINE>
<LINE>Forced me to seek delays for them and me.</LINE>
<LINE>And this it was, for other means was none:</LINE>
<LINE>The sailors sought for safety by our boat,</LINE>
<LINE>And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:</LINE>
<LINE>My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</LINE>
<LINE>Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as seafaring men provide for storms;</LINE>
<LINE>To him one of the other twins was bound,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:</LINE>
<LINE>The children thus disposed, my wife and I,</LINE>
<LINE>Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;</LINE>
<LINE>And floating straight, obedient to the stream,</LINE>
<LINE>Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</LINE>
<LINE>At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</LINE>
<LINE>Dispersed those vapours that offended us;</LINE>
<LINE>And by the benefit of his wished light,</LINE>
<LINE>The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered</LINE>
<LINE>Two ships from far making amain to us,</LINE>
<LINE>Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:</LINE>
<LINE>But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!</LINE>
<LINE>Gather the sequel by that went before.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;</LINE>
<LINE>For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEGEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, had the gods done so, I had not now</LINE>
<LINE>Worthily term'd them merciless to us!</LINE>
<LINE>For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,</LINE>
<LINE>We were encounterd by a mighty rock;</LINE>
<LINE>Which being violently borne upon,</LINE>
<LINE>Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;</LINE>
<LINE>So that, in this unjust divorce of us,</LINE>
<LINE>Fortune had left to both of us alike</LINE>
<LINE>What to delight in, what to sorrow for.</LINE>
<LINE>Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened</LINE>
<LINE>With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,</LINE>
<LINE>Was carried with more speed before the wind;</LINE>
<LINE>And in our sight they three were taken up</LINE>
<LINE>By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</LINE>
<LINE>At length, another ship had seized on us;</LINE>
<LINE>And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,</LINE>
<LINE>Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;</LINE>
<LINE>And would have reft the fishers of their prey,</LINE>
<LINE>Had not their bark been very slow of sail;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;</LINE>
<LINE>That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,</LINE>
<LINE>To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,</LINE>
<LINE>Do me the favour to dilate at full</LINE>
<LINE>What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEGEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,</LINE>
<LINE>At eighteen years became inquisitive</LINE>
<LINE>After his brother: and importuned me</LINE>
<LINE>That his attendant--so his case was like,</LINE>
<LINE>Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--</LINE>
<LINE>Might bear him company in the quest of him:</LINE>
<LINE>Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,</LINE>
<LINE>I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.</LINE>
<LINE>Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,</LINE>
<LINE>Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,</LINE>
<LINE>And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;</LINE>
<LINE>Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought</LINE>
<LINE>Or that or any place that harbours men.</LINE>
<LINE>But here must end the story of my life;</LINE>
<LINE>And happy were I in my timely death,</LINE>
<LINE>Could all my travels warrant me they live.</LINE>

<LINE>Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,</LINE>
<LINE>Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,</LINE>
<LINE>Which princes, would they, may not disannul,</LINE>
<LINE>My soul would sue as advocate for thee.</LINE>
<LINE>But, though thou art adjudged to the death</LINE>
<LINE>And passed sentence may not be recall'd</LINE>
<LINE>But to our honour's great disparagement,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet I will favour thee in what I can.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day</LINE>
<LINE>To seek thy life by beneficial help:</LINE>
<LINE>Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;</LINE>
<LINE>Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,</LINE>
<LINE>And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:</LINE>
<LINE>The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,</LINE>
<LINE>The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;</LINE>
<LINE>My mistress made it one upon my cheek:</LINE>
<LINE>She is so hot because the meat is cold;</LINE>
<LINE>The meat is cold because you come not home;</LINE>
<LINE>You come not home because you have no stomach;</LINE>
<LINE>You have no stomach having broke your fast;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have some marks of yours upon my pate,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,</LINE>
<LINE>That in such haste I sent to seek his master!</LINE>
<LINE>Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,</LINE>
<LINE>And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.</LINE>
<LINE>Good sister, let us dine and never fret:</LINE>
<LINE>A man is master of his liberty:</LINE>
<LINE>Time is their master, and, when they see time,</LINE>
<LINE>They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why should their liberty than ours be more?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.</LINE>
<LINE>There's nothing situate under heaven's eye</LINE>
<LINE>But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:</LINE>
<LINE>The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,</LINE>
<LINE>Are their males' subjects and at their controls:</LINE>
<LINE>Men, more divine, the masters of all these,</LINE>
<LINE>Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,</LINE>
<LINE>Indued with intellectual sense and souls,</LINE>
<LINE>Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,</LINE>
<LINE>Are masters to their females, and their lords:</LINE>
<LINE>Then let your will attend on their accords.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This servitude makes you to keep unwed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How if your husband start some other where?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Till he come home again, I would forbear.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;</LINE>
<LINE>They can be meek that have no other cause.</LINE>
<LINE>A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,</LINE>
<LINE>We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;</LINE>
<LINE>But were we burdened with like weight of pain,</LINE>
<LINE>As much or more would we ourselves complain:</LINE>
<LINE>So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,</LINE>
<LINE>With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,</LINE>
<LINE>But, if thou live to see like right bereft,</LINE>
<LINE>This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his</LINE>
<LINE>blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce</LINE>
<LINE>understand them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.</LINE>
<LINE>'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'</LINE>
<LINE>'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:</LINE>

<LINE>So that my errand, due unto my tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;</LINE>

<LINE>Hath homely age the alluring beauty took</LINE>
<LINE>From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:</LINE>
<LINE>Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?</LINE>
<LINE>If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:</LINE>
<LINE>Do their gay vestments his affections bait?</LINE>
<LINE>That's not my fault: he's master of my state:</LINE>
<LINE>What ruins are in me that can be found,</LINE>
<LINE>By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground</LINE>
<LINE>Of my defeatures. My decayed fair</LINE>
<LINE>A sunny look of his would soon repair</LINE>
<LINE>But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale</LINE>
<LINE>And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.</LINE>

<LINE>Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.</LINE>
<LINE>I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else what lets it but he would be here?</LINE>
<LINE>Sister, you know he promised me a chain;</LINE>
<LINE>Would that alone, alone he would detain,</LINE>
<LINE>So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!</LINE>
<LINE>I see the jewel best enamelled</LINE>
<LINE>Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,</LINE>
<LINE>That others touch, and often touching will</LINE>
<LINE>Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,</LINE>
<LINE>By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.</LINE>
<LINE>Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter DROMIO of Syracuse</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?</LINE>
<LINE>As you love strokes, so jest with me again.</LINE>
<LINE>You know no Centaur? you received no gold?</LINE>
<LINE>Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?</LINE>
<LINE>My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,</LINE>
<LINE>That thus so madly thou didst answer me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even now, even here, not half an hour since.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did not see you since you sent me hence,</LINE>
<LINE>Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,</LINE>
<LINE>And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;</LINE>
<LINE>For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am glad to see you in this merry vein:</LINE>
<LINE>What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?</LINE>
<LINE>Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Beating him</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:</LINE>
<LINE>Upon what bargain do you give it me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because that I familiarly sometimes</LINE>
<LINE>Do use you for my fool and chat with you,</LINE>
<LINE>Your sauciness will jest upon my love</LINE>
<LINE>And make a common of my serious hours.</LINE>
<LINE>When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,</LINE>
<LINE>But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.</LINE>
<LINE>If you will jest with me, know my aspect,</LINE>
<LINE>And fashion your demeanor to my looks,</LINE>
<LINE>Or I will beat this method in your sconce.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I</LINE>
<LINE>had rather have it a head: an you use these blows</LINE>
<LINE>long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce</LINE>
<LINE>it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.</LINE>
<LINE>But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dost thou not know?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I tell you why?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath</LINE>
<LINE>a wherefore.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--</LINE>
<LINE>For urging it the second time to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,</LINE>
<LINE>When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme</LINE>
<LINE>nor reason?</LINE>
<LINE>Well, sir, I thank you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thank me, sir, for what?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for</LINE>
<LINE>something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In good time, sir; what's that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Basting.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your reason?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another</LINE>
<LINE>dry basting.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a</LINE>
<LINE>time for all things.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By what rule, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald</LINE>
<LINE>pate of father Time himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let's hear it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's no time for a man to recover his hair that</LINE>
<LINE>grows bald by nature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May he not do it by fine and recovery?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the</LINE>
<LINE>lost hair of another man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,</LINE>
<LINE>so plentiful an excrement?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;</LINE>
<LINE>and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth</LINE>
<LINE>it in a kind of jollity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For what reason?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For two; and sound ones too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, not sound, I pray you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sure ones, then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Certain ones then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Name them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The one, to save the money that he spends in</LINE>
<LINE>trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not</LINE>
<LINE>drop in his porridge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You would all this time have proved there is no</LINE>
<LINE>time for all things.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair</LINE>
<LINE>lost by nature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But your reason was not substantial, why there is no</LINE>
<LINE>time to recover.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore</LINE>
<LINE>to the world's end will have bald followers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:</LINE>
<LINE>But, soft! who wafts us yonder?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:</LINE>
<LINE>Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;</LINE>
<LINE>I am not Adriana nor thy wife.</LINE>
<LINE>The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow</LINE>
<LINE>That never words were music to thine ear,</LINE>
<LINE>That never object pleasing in thine eye,</LINE>
<LINE>That never touch well welcome to thy hand,</LINE>
<LINE>That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.</LINE>
<LINE>How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou art thus estranged from thyself?</LINE>
<LINE>Thyself I call it, being strange to me,</LINE>
<LINE>That, undividable, incorporate,</LINE>
<LINE>Am better than thy dear self's better part.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!</LINE>
<LINE>For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall</LINE>
<LINE>A drop of water in the breaking gulf,</LINE>
<LINE>And take unmingled that same drop again,</LINE>
<LINE>Without addition or diminishing,</LINE>
<LINE>As take from me thyself and not me too.</LINE>
<LINE>How dearly would it touch me to the quick,</LINE>
<LINE>Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious</LINE>
<LINE>And that this body, consecrate to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>By ruffian lust should be contaminate!</LINE>
<LINE>Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me</LINE>
<LINE>And hurl the name of husband in my face</LINE>
<LINE>And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow</LINE>
<LINE>And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring</LINE>
<LINE>And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?</LINE>
<LINE>I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.</LINE>
<LINE>I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;</LINE>
<LINE>My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:</LINE>
<LINE>For if we too be one and thou play false,</LINE>
<LINE>I do digest the poison of thy flesh,</LINE>
<LINE>Being strumpeted by thy contagion.</LINE>
<LINE>Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;</LINE>
<LINE>I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:</LINE>
<LINE>In Ephesus I am but two hours old,</LINE>
<LINE>As strange unto your town as to your talk;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Want wit in all one word to understand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you!</LINE>
<LINE>When were you wont to use my sister thus?</LINE>
<LINE>She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By Dromio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By thee; and this thou didst return from him,</LINE>
<LINE>That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,</LINE>
<LINE>Denied my house for his, me for his wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?</LINE>
<LINE>What is the course and drift of your compact?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I, sir? I never saw her till this time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Villain, thou liest; for even her very words</LINE>
<LINE>Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I never spake with her in all my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How can she thus then call us by our names,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless it be by inspiration.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How ill agrees it with your gravity</LINE>
<LINE>To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,</LINE>
<LINE>Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!</LINE>
<LINE>Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,</LINE>
<LINE>But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,</LINE>
<LINE>Makes me with thy strength to communicate:</LINE>
<LINE>If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,</LINE>
<LINE>Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion</LINE>
<LINE>Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:</LINE>
<LINE>What, was I married to her in my dream?</LINE>
<LINE>Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?</LINE>
<LINE>What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?</LINE>
<LINE>Until I know this sure uncertainty,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.</LINE>
<LINE>This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!</LINE>
<LINE>We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:</LINE>
<LINE>If we obey them not, this will ensue,</LINE>
<LINE>They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?</LINE>
<LINE>Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am transformed, master, am I not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think thou art in mind, and so am I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast thine own form.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, I am an ape.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be</LINE>
<LINE>But I should know her as well as she knows me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,</LINE>
<LINE>To put the finger in the eye and weep,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.</LINE>
<LINE>Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day</LINE>
<LINE>And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.</LINE>
<LINE>Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,</LINE>
<LINE>Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?</LINE>
<LINE>Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?</LINE>
<LINE>Known unto these, and to myself disguised!</LINE>
<LINE>I'll say as they say and persever so,</LINE>
<LINE>And in this mist at all adventures go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master, shall I be porter at the gate?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus, DROMIO of Ephesus,
ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;</LINE>
<LINE>My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:</LINE>
<LINE>Say that I linger'd with you at your shop</LINE>
<LINE>To see the making of her carcanet,</LINE>
<LINE>And that to-morrow you will bring it home.</LINE>
<LINE>But here's a villain that would face me down</LINE>
<LINE>He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,</LINE>
<LINE>And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,</LINE>
<LINE>And that I did deny my wife and house.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;</LINE>
<LINE>That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:</LINE>
<LINE>If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,</LINE>
<LINE>Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think thou art an ass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, so it doth appear</LINE>
<LINE>By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.</LINE>
<LINE>I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,</LINE>
<LINE>You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer</LINE>
<LINE>May answer my good will and your good welcome here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,</LINE>
<LINE>A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHAZAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHAZAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:</LINE>
<LINE>But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;</LINE>
<LINE>Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.</LINE>
<LINE>But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.</LINE>

<LINE>Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.</LINE>
<LINE>Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st</LINE>
<LINE>for such store,</LINE>
<LINE>When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE><STAGEDIR>Within</STAGEDIR>  I thought to have asked you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Within</STAGEDIR>  And you said no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master, knock the door hard.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Within</STAGEDIR>  Let him knock till it ache.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Within</STAGEDIR>  Who is that at the door that keeps all</LINE>
<LINE>this noise?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Within</STAGEDIR>  By my troth, your town is troubled with</LINE>
<LINE>unruly boys.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you there, wife? you might have come before.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Within</STAGEDIR>  Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANGELO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would</LINE>
<LINE>fain have either.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHAZAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.</LINE>
<LINE>Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:</LINE>
<LINE>It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Within</STAGEDIR>  Break any breaking here, and I'll break your</LINE>
<LINE>knave's pate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Within</STAGEDIR>  It seems thou want'st breaking: out upon</LINE>
<LINE>thee, hind!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee,</LINE>
<LINE>let me in.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Within</STAGEDIR>  Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?</LINE>
<LINE>For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;</LINE>
<LINE>If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTHAZAR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!</LINE>
<LINE>Herein you war against your reputation</LINE>
<LINE>And draw within the compass of suspect</LINE>
<LINE>The unviolated honour of your wife.</LINE>
<LINE>Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,</LINE>
<LINE>Her sober virtue, years and modesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:</LINE>
<LINE>And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse</LINE>
<LINE>Why at this time the doors are made against you.</LINE>
<LINE>Be ruled by me: depart in patience,</LINE>
<LINE>And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,</LINE>
<LINE>And about evening come yourself alone</LINE>
<LINE>To know the reason of this strange restraint.</LINE>
<LINE>If by strong hand you offer to break in</LINE>
<LINE>Now in the stirring passage of the day,</LINE>
<LINE>A vulgar comment will be made of it,</LINE>
<LINE>And that supposed by the common rout</LINE>
<LINE>Against your yet ungalled estimation</LINE>
<LINE>That may with foul intrusion enter in</LINE>
<LINE>And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;</LINE>
<LINE>For slander lives upon succession,</LINE>
<LINE>For ever housed where it gets possession.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,</LINE>
<LINE>And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.</LINE>
<LINE>I know a wench of excellent discourse,</LINE>
<LINE>Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:</LINE>
<LINE>There will we dine. This woman that I mean,</LINE>
<LINE>My wife--but, I protest, without desert--</LINE>
<LINE>Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:</LINE>
<LINE>To her will we to dinner.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To Angelo</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Get you home</LINE>
<LINE>And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:</LINE>
<LINE>Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;</LINE>
<LINE>For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--</LINE>
<LINE>Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--</LINE>
<LINE>Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.</LINE>
<LINE>Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANGELO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter LUCIANA and ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And may it be that you have quite forgot</LINE>
<LINE>A husband's office? shall, Antipholus.</LINE>
<LINE>Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?</LINE>
<LINE>Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?</LINE>
<LINE>If you did wed my sister for her wealth,</LINE>
<LINE>Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:</LINE>
<LINE>Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;</LINE>
<LINE>Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:</LINE>
<LINE>Let not my sister read it in your eye;</LINE>
<LINE>Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;</LINE>
<LINE>Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;</LINE>
<LINE>Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;</LINE>
<LINE>Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;</LINE>
<LINE>Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;</LINE>
<LINE>Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?</LINE>
<LINE>What simple thief brags of his own attaint?</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed</LINE>
<LINE>And let her read it in thy looks at board:</LINE>
<LINE>Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;</LINE>
<LINE>Ill deeds are doubled with an evil word.</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, poor women! make us but believe,</LINE>
<LINE>Being compact of credit, that you love us;</LINE>
<LINE>Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;</LINE>
<LINE>We in your motion turn and you may move us.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, gentle brother, get you in again;</LINE>
<LINE>Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,</LINE>
<LINE>When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--</LINE>
<LINE>Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not</LINE>
<LINE>Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.</LINE>
<LINE>Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;</LINE>
<LINE>Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,</LINE>
<LINE>Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,</LINE>
<LINE>The folded meaning of your words' deceit.</LINE>
<LINE>Against my soul's pure truth why labour you</LINE>
<LINE>To make it wander in an unknown field?</LINE>
<LINE>Are you a god? would you create me new?</LINE>
<LINE>Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.</LINE>
<LINE>But if that I am I, then well I know</LINE>
<LINE>Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor to her bed no homage do I owe</LINE>
<LINE>Far more, far more to you do I decline.</LINE>
<LINE>O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,</LINE>
<LINE>To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:</LINE>
<LINE>Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:</LINE>
<LINE>Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,</LINE>
<LINE>And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,</LINE>
<LINE>And in that glorious supposition think</LINE>
<LINE>He gains by death that hath such means to die:</LINE>
<LINE>Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, are you mad, that you do reason so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is a fault that springeth from your eye.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why call you me love? call my sister so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy sister's sister.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's my sister.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No;</LINE>
<LINE>It is thyself, mine own self's better part,</LINE>
<LINE>Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,</LINE>
<LINE>My food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim,</LINE>
<LINE>My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All this my sister is, or else should be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Thee will I love and with thee lead my life:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me thy hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, soft, air! hold you still:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll fetch my sister, to get her good will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter DROMIO of Syracuse</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, how now, Dromio! where runn'st thou so fast?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man?</LINE>
<LINE>am I myself?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman; one</LINE>
<LINE>that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What claim lays she to thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your</LINE>
<LINE>horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, I</LINE>
<LINE>being a beast, she would have me; but that she,</LINE>
<LINE>being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is she?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may</LINE>
<LINE>not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have</LINE>
<LINE>but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a</LINE>
<LINE>wondrous fat marriage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How dost thou mean a fat marriage?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease;</LINE>
<LINE>and I know not what use to put her to but to make a</LINE>
<LINE>lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I</LINE>
<LINE>warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a</LINE>
<LINE>Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday,</LINE>
<LINE>she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What complexion is she of?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half so</LINE>
<LINE>clean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go over</LINE>
<LINE>shoes in the grime of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's a fault that water will mend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's her name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that's</LINE>
<LINE>an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from</LINE>
<LINE>hip to hip.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then she bears some breadth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:</LINE>
<LINE>she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out</LINE>
<LINE>countries in her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In what part of her body stands Ireland?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where Scotland?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where France?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war</LINE>
<LINE>against her heir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where England?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no</LINE>
<LINE>whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,</LINE>
<LINE>by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where Spain?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where America, the Indies?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Oh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished with</LINE>
<LINE>rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich</LINE>
<LINE>aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole</LINE>
<LINE>armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this</LINE>
<LINE>drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd me</LINE>
<LINE>Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what</LINE>
<LINE>privy marks I had about me, as, the mark of my</LINE>
<LINE>shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my</LINE>
<LINE>left arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch:</LINE>
<LINE>And, I think, if my breast had not been made of</LINE>
<LINE>faith and my heart of steel,</LINE>
<LINE>She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made</LINE>
<LINE>me turn i' the wheel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go hie thee presently, post to the road:</LINE>
<LINE>An if the wind blow any way from shore,</LINE>
<LINE>I will not harbour in this town to-night:</LINE>
<LINE>If any bark put forth, come to the mart,</LINE>
<LINE>Where I will walk till thou return to me.</LINE>
<LINE>If every one knows us and we know none,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As from a bear a man would run for life,</LINE>
<LINE>So fly I from her that would be my wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's none but witches do inhabit here;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.</LINE>
<LINE>She that doth call me husband, even my soul</LINE>
<LINE>Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,</LINE>
<LINE>Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Of such enchanting presence and discourse,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath almost made me traitor to myself:</LINE>
<LINE>But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.</LINE>
<LINE>Go home with it and please your wife withal;</LINE>
<LINE>And soon at supper-time I'll visit you</LINE>
<LINE>And then receive my money for the chain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>What I should think of this, I cannot tell:</LINE>

<LINE>That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.</LINE>
<LINE>I see a man here needs not live by shifts,</LINE>
<LINE>When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.</LINE>

<LINE>A man is well holp up that trusts to you:</LINE>
<LINE>I promised your presence and the chain;</LINE>
<LINE>But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.</LINE>
<LINE>Belike you thought our love would last too long,</LINE>
<LINE>If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANGELO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Saving your merry humour, here's the note</LINE>
<LINE>How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,</LINE>
<LINE>The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion.</LINE>
<LINE>Which doth amount to three odd ducats more</LINE>
<LINE>Than I stand debted to this gentleman:</LINE>
<LINE>I pray you, see him presently discharged,</LINE>
<LINE>For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am not furnish'd with the present money;</LINE>
<LINE>Besides, I have some business in the town.</LINE>
<LINE>Good signior, take the stranger to my house</LINE>
<LINE>And with you take the chain and bid my wife</LINE>
<LINE>Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:</LINE>
<LINE>Perchance I will be there as soon as you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANGELO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?</LINE>

<LINE>No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.</LINE>

<LINE>Or else you may return without your money.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ANGELO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:</LINE>
<LINE>Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>And I, to blame, have held him here too long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse</LINE>
<LINE>Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.</LINE>
<LINE>I should have chid you for not bringing it,</LINE>
<LINE>But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Merchant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My business cannot brook this dalliance.</LINE>
<LINE>Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no:</LINE>

<LINE>Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer,</LINE>
<LINE>I would not spare my brother in this case,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum</LINE>
<LINE>That stays but till her owner comes aboard,</LINE>
<LINE>And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought</LINE>
<LINE>The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae.</LINE>
<LINE>The ship is in her trim; the merry wind</LINE>
<LINE>Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all</LINE>
<LINE>But for their owner, master, and yourself.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You sent me for a rope's end as soon:</LINE>
<LINE>You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will debate this matter at more leisure</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?</LINE>
<LINE>Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye</LINE>
<LINE>That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?</LINE>
<LINE>Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?</LINE>
<LINE>What observation madest thou in this case</LINE>
<LINE>Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First he denied you had in him no right.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He meant he did me none; the more my spite.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then swore he that he was a stranger here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And what said he?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With words that in an honest suit might move.</LINE>
<LINE>First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Didst speak him fair?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still;</LINE>
<LINE>My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.</LINE>
<LINE>He is deformed, crooked, old and sere,</LINE>
<LINE>Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;</LINE>
<LINE>Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;</LINE>
<LINE>Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who would be jealous then of such a one?</LINE>
<LINE>No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, but I think him better than I say,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.</LINE>
<LINE>A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;</LINE>
<LINE>One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;</LINE>
<LINE>A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;</LINE>
<LINE>A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;</LINE>
<LINE>A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that</LINE>
<LINE>countermands</LINE>
<LINE>The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands;</LINE>
<LINE>A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;</LINE>
<LINE>One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, man, what is the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;</LINE>
<LINE>But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell.</LINE>
<LINE>Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go fetch it, sister.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Luciana</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>This I wonder at,</LINE>
<LINE>That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me, was he arrested on a band?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;</LINE>
<LINE>A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, the chain?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no, the bell: 'tis time that I were gone:</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he's</LINE>
<LINE>worth, to season.</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say</LINE>
<LINE>That Time comes stealing on by night and day?</LINE>
<LINE>If Time be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?</LINE>

<LINE>And every one doth call me by my name.</LINE>
<LINE>Some tender money to me; some invite me;</LINE>
<LINE>Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;</LINE>
<LINE>Some offer me commodities to buy:</LINE>
<LINE>Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop</LINE>
<LINE>And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,</LINE>
<LINE>And therewithal took measure of my body.</LINE>
<LINE>Sure, these are but imaginary wiles</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam</LINE>
<LINE>that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's</LINE>

<LINE>behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you</LINE>

<LINE>I understand thee not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a</LINE>
<LINE>bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob</LINE>
<LINE>and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed</LINE>
<LINE>men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up</LINE>

<LINE>morris-pike.</LINE>

<LINE>What, thou meanest an officer?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band, he that brings</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam; and here</LINE>
<LINE>she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof</LINE>
<LINE>comes that the wenches say 'God damn me;' that's as</LINE>
<LINE>much to say 'God make me a light wench.' It is</LINE>
<LINE>written, they appear to men like angels of light:</LINE>
<LINE>light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn;</LINE>

<LINE>Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,</LINE>
<LINE>Else would he never so demean himself.</LINE>
<LINE>A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,</LINE>
<LINE>And for the same he promised me a chain:</LINE>
<LINE>Both one and other he denies me now.</LINE>
<LINE>The reason that I gather he is mad,</LINE>
<LINE>Besides this present instance of his rage,</LINE>
<LINE>Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,</LINE>
<LINE>Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.</LINE>
<LINE>Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,</LINE>
<LINE>On purpose shut the doors against his way.</LINE>
<LINE>My way is now to hie home to his house,</LINE>
<LINE>And tell his wife that, being lunatic,</LINE>
<LINE>He rush'd into my house and took perforce</LINE>
<LINE>My ring away. This course I fittest choose;</LINE>

<LINE>I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I returned.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Officer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good, now, hold thy tongue.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long</LINE>
<LINE>ears. I have served him from the hour of my</LINE>
<LINE>nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his</LINE>
<LINE>hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he</LINE>
<LINE>heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me</LINE>
<LINE>with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep;</LINE>
<LINE>raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with</LINE>
<LINE>it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when</LINE>
<LINE>I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a</LINE>
<LINE>beggar wont her brat; and, I think when he hath</LINE>
<LINE>lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You minion, you, are these your customers?</LINE>
<LINE>Did this companion with the saffron face</LINE>
<LINE>Revel and feast it at my house to-day,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut</LINE>
<LINE>And I denied to enter in my house?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O husband, God doth know you dined at home;</LINE>
<LINE>Where would you had remain'd until this time,</LINE>
<LINE>Free from these slanders and this open shame!</LINE>

<LINE>Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.</LINE>

<LINE>Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>And did not I in rage depart from thence?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>In verity you did; my bones bear witness,</LINE>
<LINE>That since have felt the vigour of his rage.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PINCH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?</LINE>

<LINE>He came to me and I deliver'd it.</LINE>

<LINE>Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.</LINE>

<LINE>Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;</LINE>

<LINE>What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Officer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is my prisoner: if I let him go,</LINE>

<LINE>I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, how grows it due?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Officer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Due for a chain your husband had of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Courtezan</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When as your husband all in rage to-day</LINE>
<LINE>Came to my house and took away my ring--</LINE>
<LINE>The ring I saw upon his finger now--</LINE>
<LINE>Straight after did I meet him with a chain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It may be so, but I did never see it.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:</LINE>

<LINE>Faith, stay here this night; they will surely do us</LINE>
<LINE>no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold:</LINE>
<LINE>methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for</LINE>
<LINE>the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of</LINE>
<LINE>me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and</LINE>
<LINE>turn witch.</LINE>

<LINE>How is the man esteemed here in the city?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANGELO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of very reverend reputation, sir,</LINE>

<LINE>Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Antipholus, I wonder much</LINE>
<LINE>That you would put me to this shame and trouble;</LINE>
<LINE>And, not without some scandal to yourself,</LINE>
<LINE>With circumstance and oaths so to deny</LINE>
<LINE>This chain which now you wear so openly:</LINE>
<LINE>Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,</LINE>
<LINE>You have done wrong to this my honest friend,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, but for staying on our controversy,</LINE>
<LINE>Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:</LINE>
<LINE>This chain you had of me; can you deny it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think I had; I never did deny it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Merchant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Merchant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These ears of mine, thou know'st did hear thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest</LINE>
<LINE>To walk where any honest man resort.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty</LINE>
<LINE>Against thee presently, if thou darest stand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>AEMELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.</LINE>
<LINE>Let us come in, that we may bind him fast</LINE>
<LINE>And bear him home for his recovery.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANGELO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I knew he was not in his perfect wits.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Merchant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sorry now that I did draw on him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEMELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How long hath this possession held the man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,</LINE>
<LINE>And much different from the man he was;</LINE>
<LINE>But till this afternoon his passion</LINE>
<LINE>Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEMELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?</LINE>
<LINE>Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye</LINE>
<LINE>Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?</LINE>
<LINE>A sin prevailing much in youthful men,</LINE>
<LINE>Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.</LINE>
<LINE>Which of these sorrows is he subject to?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To none of these, except it be the last;</LINE>
<LINE>Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEMELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You should for that have reprehended him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, so I did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEMELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but not rough enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As roughly as my modesty would let me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEMELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Haply, in private.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And in assemblies too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEMELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but not enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was the copy of our conference:</LINE>
<LINE>In bed he slept not for my urging it;</LINE>
<LINE>At board he fed not for my urging it;</LINE>
<LINE>Alone, it was the subject of my theme;</LINE>
<LINE>In company I often glanced it;</LINE>
<LINE>Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEMELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And thereof came it that the man was mad.</LINE>
<LINE>The venom clamours of a jealous woman</LINE>
<LINE>Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.</LINE>
<LINE>It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore comes it that his head is light.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:</LINE>
<LINE>Unquiet meals make ill digestions;</LINE>
<LINE>Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;</LINE>
<LINE>And what's a fever but a fit of madness?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue</LINE>
<LINE>But moody and dull melancholy,</LINE>
<LINE>Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,</LINE>
<LINE>And at her heels a huge infectious troop</LINE>
<LINE>Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?</LINE>
<LINE>In food, in sport and life-preserving rest</LINE>
<LINE>To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:</LINE>
<LINE>The consequence is then thy jealous fits</LINE>
<LINE>Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She never reprehended him but mildly,</LINE>
<LINE>When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly.</LINE>
<LINE>Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She did betray me to my own reproof.</LINE>
<LINE>Good people enter and lay hold on him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEMELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, not a creature enters in my house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then let your servants bring my husband forth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEMELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,</LINE>
<LINE>And it shall privilege him from your hands</LINE>
<LINE>Till I have brought him to his wits again,</LINE>
<LINE>Or lose my labour in assaying it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will attend my husband, be his nurse,</LINE>
<LINE>Diet his sickness, for it is my office,</LINE>
<LINE>And will have no attorney but myself;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore let me have him home with me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEMELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be patient; for I will not let him stir</LINE>
<LINE>Till I have used the approved means I have,</LINE>
<LINE>With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,</LINE>
<LINE>To make of him a formal man again:</LINE>
<LINE>It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,</LINE>
<LINE>A charitable duty of my order.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore depart and leave him here with me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not hence and leave my husband here:</LINE>
<LINE>And ill it doth beseem your holiness</LINE>
<LINE>To separate the husband and the wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEMELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.</LINE>

<LINE>Complain unto the duke of this indignity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet</LINE>
<LINE>And never rise until my tears and prayers</LINE>
<LINE>Have won his grace to come in person hither</LINE>
<LINE>And take perforce my husband from the abbess.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Merchant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By this, I think, the dial points at five:</LINE>
<LINE>Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person</LINE>
<LINE>Comes this way to the melancholy vale,</LINE>
<LINE>The place of death and sorry execution,</LINE>
<LINE>Behind the ditches of the abbey here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANGELO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon what cause?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Merchant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,</LINE>
<LINE>Who put unluckily into this bay</LINE>
<LINE>Against the laws and statutes of this town,</LINE>
<LINE>Beheaded publicly for his offence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANGELO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See where they come: we will behold his death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter DUKE SOLINUS, attended; AEGEON bareheaded; with the
Headsman and other Officers</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet once again proclaim it publicly,</LINE>
<LINE>If any friend will pay the sum for him,</LINE>
<LINE>He shall not die; so much we tender him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:</LINE>
<LINE>It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom I made lord of me and all I had,</LINE>
<LINE>At your important letters,--this ill day</LINE>
<LINE>A most outrageous fit of madness took him;</LINE>
<LINE>That desperately he hurried through the street,</LINE>
<LINE>With him his bondman, all as mad as he--</LINE>
<LINE>Doing displeasure to the citizens</LINE>
<LINE>By rushing in their houses, bearing thence</LINE>
<LINE>Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.</LINE>
<LINE>Once did I get him bound and sent him home,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,</LINE>
<LINE>That here and there his fury had committed.</LINE>
<LINE>Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,</LINE>
<LINE>He broke from those that had the guard of him;</LINE>
<LINE>And with his mad attendant and himself,</LINE>
<LINE>Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,</LINE>
<LINE>Met us again and madly bent on us,</LINE>
<LINE>Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,</LINE>
<LINE>We came again to bind them. Then they fled</LINE>
<LINE>Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:</LINE>
<LINE>And here the abbess shuts the gates on us</LINE>
<LINE>And will not suffer us to fetch him out,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command</LINE>
<LINE>Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Long since thy husband served me in my wars,</LINE>
<LINE>And I to thee engaged a prince's word,</LINE>
<LINE>When thou didst make him master of thy bed,</LINE>
<LINE>To do him all the grace and good I could.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate</LINE>
<LINE>And bid the lady abbess come to me.</LINE>
<LINE>I will determine this before I stir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Servant</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!</LINE>
<LINE>My master and his man are both broke loose,</LINE>
<LINE>Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor</LINE>
<LINE>Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;</LINE>
<LINE>And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him</LINE>
<LINE>Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:</LINE>
<LINE>My master preaches patience to him and the while</LINE>
<LINE>His man with scissors nicks him like a fool,</LINE>
<LINE>And sure, unless you send some present help,</LINE>
<LINE>Between them they will kill the conjurer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,</LINE>
<LINE>And that is false thou dost report to us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;</LINE>
<LINE>I have not breathed almost since I did see it.</LINE>
<LINE>He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,</LINE>
<LINE>To scorch your face and to disfigure you.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Cry within</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress. fly, be gone!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you,</LINE>
<LINE>That he is borne about invisible:</LINE>
<LINE>Even now we housed him in the abbey here;</LINE>
<LINE>And now he's there, past thought of human reason.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me justice!</LINE>
<LINE>Even for the service that long since I did thee,</LINE>
<LINE>When I bestrid thee in the wars and took</LINE>
<LINE>Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood</LINE>
<LINE>That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEGEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,</LINE>
<LINE>I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!</LINE>
<LINE>She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife,</LINE>
<LINE>That hath abused and dishonour'd me</LINE>
<LINE>Even in the strength and height of injury!</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond imagination is the wrong</LINE>
<LINE>That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,</LINE>
<LINE>While she with harlots feasted in my house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister</LINE>
<LINE>To-day did dine together. So befall my soul</LINE>
<LINE>As this is false he burdens me withal!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,</LINE>
<LINE>But she tells to your highness simple truth!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANGELO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:</LINE>
<LINE>In this the madman justly chargeth them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My liege, I am advised what I say,</LINE>
<LINE>Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,</LINE>
<LINE>Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.</LINE>
<LINE>This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:</LINE>
<LINE>That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,</LINE>
<LINE>Could witness it, for he was with me then;</LINE>
<LINE>Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,</LINE>
<LINE>Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,</LINE>
<LINE>Where Balthazar and I did dine together.</LINE>
<LINE>Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,</LINE>
<LINE>I went to seek him: in the street I met him</LINE>
<LINE>And in his company that gentleman.</LINE>
<LINE>There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down</LINE>
<LINE>That I this day of him received the chain,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which</LINE>
<LINE>He did arrest me with an officer.</LINE>
<LINE>I did obey, and sent my peasant home</LINE>
<LINE>For certain ducats: he with none return'd</LINE>
<LINE>Then fairly I bespoke the officer</LINE>
<LINE>To go in person with me to my house.</LINE>
<LINE>By the way we met</LINE>
<LINE>My wife, her sister, and a rabble more</LINE>
<LINE>Of vile confederates. Along with them</LINE>
<LINE>They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,</LINE>
<LINE>A mere anatomy, a mountebank,</LINE>
<LINE>A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,</LINE>
<LINE>A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,</LINE>
<LINE>A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,</LINE>
<LINE>Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,</LINE>
<LINE>And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,</LINE>
<LINE>And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,</LINE>
<LINE>Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together</LINE>
<LINE>They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence</LINE>
<LINE>And in a dark and dankish vault at home</LINE>
<LINE>There left me and my man, both bound together;</LINE>
<LINE>Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,</LINE>
<LINE>I gain'd my freedom, and immediately</LINE>
<LINE>Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech</LINE>
<LINE>To give me ample satisfaction</LINE>
<LINE>For these deep shames and great indignities.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANGELO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,</LINE>
<LINE>That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But had he such a chain of thee or no?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANGELO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,</LINE>
<LINE>These people saw the chain about his neck.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Merchant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine</LINE>
<LINE>Heard you confess you had the chain of him</LINE>
<LINE>After you first forswore it on the mart:</LINE>
<LINE>And thereupon I drew my sword on you;</LINE>
<LINE>And then you fled into this abbey here,</LINE>
<LINE>From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I never came within these abbey-walls,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:</LINE>
<LINE>I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!</LINE>
<LINE>And this is false you burden me withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what an intricate impeach is this!</LINE>
<LINE>I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.</LINE>
<LINE>If here you housed him, here he would have been;</LINE>
<LINE>If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:</LINE>
<LINE>You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here</LINE>
<LINE>Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Courtezan</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Courtezan</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.</LINE>
<LINE>I think you are all mated or stark mad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit one to Abbess</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEGEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:</LINE>
<LINE>Haply I see a friend will save my life</LINE>
<LINE>And pay the sum that may deliver me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEGEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?</LINE>
<LINE>And is not that your bondman, Dromio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Within this hour I was his bondman sir,</LINE>
<LINE>But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:</LINE>
<LINE>Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEGEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sure you both of you remember me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;</LINE>
<LINE>For lately we were bound, as you are now</LINE>
<LINE>You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEGEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why look you strange on me? you know me well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEGEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,</LINE>
<LINE>And careful hours with time's deformed hand</LINE>
<LINE>Have written strange defeatures in my face:</LINE>
<LINE>But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEGEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dromio, nor thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, trust me, sir, nor I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEGEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sure thou dost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a</LINE>
<LINE>man denies, you are now bound to believe him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEGEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not know my voice! O time's extremity,</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue</LINE>
<LINE>In seven short years, that here my only son</LINE>
<LINE>Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?</LINE>
<LINE>Though now this grained face of mine be hid</LINE>
<LINE>In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the conduits of my blood froze up,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet hath my night of life some memory,</LINE>
<LINE>My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,</LINE>
<LINE>My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:</LINE>
<LINE>All these old witnesses--I cannot err--</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I never saw my father in my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEGEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The duke and all that know me in the city</LINE>
<LINE>Can witness with me that it is not so</LINE>
<LINE>I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years</LINE>
<LINE>Have I been patron to Antipholus,</LINE>
<LINE>During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:</LINE>
<LINE>I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter AEMILIA, with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and
DROMIO of Syracuse</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEMELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>All gather to see them</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One of these men is Genius to the other;</LINE>
<LINE>And so of these. Which is the natural man,</LINE>
<LINE>And which the spirit? who deciphers them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I, sir, am Dromio; pray, let me stay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, my old master! who hath bound him here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEMELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds</LINE>
<LINE>And gain a husband by his liberty.</LINE>
<LINE>Speak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man</LINE>
<LINE>That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia</LINE>
<LINE>That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:</LINE>
<LINE>O, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak,</LINE>
<LINE>And speak unto the same AEmilia!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEGEON</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I dream not, thou art AEmilia:</LINE>
<LINE>If thou art she, tell me where is that son</LINE>
<LINE>That floated with thee on the fatal raft?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEMELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By men of Epidamnum he and I</LINE>
<LINE>And the twin Dromio all were taken up;</LINE>
<LINE>But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth</LINE>
<LINE>By force took Dromio and my son from them</LINE>
<LINE>And me they left with those of Epidamnum.</LINE>
<LINE>What then became of them I cannot tell</LINE>
<LINE>I to this fortune that you see me in.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, here begins his morning story right;</LINE>
<LINE>These two Antipholuses, these two so like,</LINE>
<LINE>And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--</LINE>
<LINE>Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--</LINE>
<LINE>These are the parents to these children,</LINE>
<LINE>Which accidentally are met together.</LINE>
<LINE>Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I with him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,</LINE>
<LINE>Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which of you two did dine with me to-day?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I, gentle mistress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And are not you my husband?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; I say nay to that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so do I; yet did she call me so:</LINE>
<LINE>And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,</LINE>
<LINE>Did call me brother.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To Luciana</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What I told you then,</LINE>
<LINE>I hope I shall have leisure to make good;</LINE>
<LINE>If this be not a dream I see and hear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANGELO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think it be, sir; I deny it not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANGELO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think I did, sir; I deny it not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADRIANA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,</LINE>
<LINE>By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, none by me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This purse of ducats I received from you,</LINE>
<LINE>And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.</LINE>
<LINE>I see we still did meet each other's man,</LINE>
<LINE>And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,</LINE>
<LINE>And thereupon these errors are arose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These ducats pawn I for my father here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It shall not need; thy father hath his life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Courtezan</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I must have that diamond from you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEMELIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains</LINE>
<LINE>To go with us into the abbey here</LINE>
<LINE>And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:</LINE>
<LINE>And all that are assembled in this place,</LINE>
<LINE>That by this sympathized one day's error</LINE>
<LINE>Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,</LINE>
<LINE>And we shall make full satisfaction.</LINE>
<LINE>Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail</LINE>
<LINE>Of you, my sons; and till this present hour</LINE>
<LINE>My heavy burden ne'er delivered.</LINE>
<LINE>The duke, my husband and my children both,</LINE>
<LINE>And you the calendars of their nativity,</LINE>
<LINE>Go to a gossips' feast and go with me;</LINE>
<LINE>After so long grief, such festivity!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE SOLINUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse, Antipholus

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio:</LINE>
<LINE>Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon:</LINE>
<LINE>Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is a fat friend at your master's house,</LINE>
<LINE>That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner:</LINE>
<LINE>She now shall be my sister, not my wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother:</LINE>
<LINE>I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.</LINE>
<LINE>Will you walk in to see their gossiping?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not I, sir; you are my elder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's a question: how shall we try it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, then, thus:</LINE>
<LINE>We came into the world like brother and brother;</LINE>
<LINE>And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves,

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>All</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak, speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>All</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Resolved. resolved.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>All</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We know't, we know't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.</LINE>
<LINE>Is't a verdict?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>All</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One word, good citizens.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.</LINE>
<LINE>What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they</LINE>
<LINE>would yield us but the superfluity, while it were</LINE>
<LINE>wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;</LINE>
<LINE>but they think we are too dear: the leanness that</LINE>
<LINE>afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an</LINE>
<LINE>inventory to particularise their abundance; our</LINE>
<LINE>sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with</LINE>
<LINE>our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I</LINE>
<LINE>speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>All</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Consider you what services he has done for his country?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very well; and could be content to give him good</LINE>
<LINE>report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, but speak not maliciously.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did</LINE>
<LINE>it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be</LINE>
<LINE>content to say it was for his country he did it to</LINE>
<LINE>please his mother and to be partly proud; which he</LINE>
<LINE>is, even till the altitude of his virtue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What he cannot help in his nature, you account a</LINE>
<LINE>vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;</LINE>
<LINE>he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Shouts within</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What shouts are these? The other side o' the city</LINE>
<LINE>is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>All</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Soft! who comes here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved</LINE>
<LINE>the people.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you</LINE>
<LINE>With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have</LINE>
<LINE>had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,</LINE>
<LINE>which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor</LINE>
<LINE>suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we</LINE>
<LINE>have strong arms too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,</LINE>
<LINE>Will you undo yourselves?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We cannot, sir, we are undone already.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I tell you, friends, most charitable care</LINE>
<LINE>Have the patricians of you. For your wants,</LINE>
<LINE>Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well</LINE>
<LINE>Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them</LINE>
<LINE>Against the Roman state, whose course will on</LINE>
<LINE>The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs</LINE>
<LINE>Of more strong link asunder than can ever</LINE>
<LINE>Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,</LINE>
<LINE>The gods, not the patricians, make it, and</LINE>
<LINE>Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,</LINE>
<LINE>You are transported by calamity</LINE>
<LINE>Thither where more attends you, and you slander</LINE>
<LINE>The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,</LINE>
<LINE>When you curse them as enemies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us</LINE>
<LINE>yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses</LINE>
<LINE>crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to</LINE>
<LINE>support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act</LINE>
<LINE>established against the rich, and provide more</LINE>
<LINE>piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain</LINE>
<LINE>the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and</LINE>
<LINE>there's all the love they bear us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Either you must</LINE>
<LINE>Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,</LINE>
<LINE>Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you</LINE>
<LINE>A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;</LINE>
<LINE>But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture</LINE>
<LINE>To stale 't a little more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to</LINE>
<LINE>fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please</LINE>
<LINE>you, deliver.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There was a time when all the body's members</LINE>
<LINE>Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:</LINE>
<LINE>That only like a gulf it did remain</LINE>
<LINE>I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,</LINE>
<LINE>Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing</LINE>
<LINE>Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments</LINE>
<LINE>Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,</LINE>
<LINE>And, mutually participate, did minister</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the appetite and affection common</LINE>
<LINE>Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir, what answer made the belly?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,</LINE>
<LINE>Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--</LINE>
<LINE>For, look you, I may make the belly smile</LINE>
<LINE>As well as speak--it tauntingly replied</LINE>
<LINE>To the discontented members, the mutinous parts</LINE>
<LINE>That envied his receipt; even so most fitly</LINE>
<LINE>As you malign our senators for that</LINE>
<LINE>They are not such as you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your belly's answer? What!</LINE>
<LINE>The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,</LINE>
<LINE>The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,</LINE>
<LINE>Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.</LINE>
<LINE>With other muniments and petty helps</LINE>
<LINE>In this our fabric, if that they--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What then?</LINE>
<LINE>'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Who is the sink o' the body,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, what then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The former agents, if they did complain,</LINE>
<LINE>What could the belly answer?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will tell you</LINE>
<LINE>If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--</LINE>
<LINE>Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ye're long about it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Note me this, good friend;</LINE>
<LINE>Your most grave belly was deliberate,</LINE>
<LINE>Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:</LINE>
<LINE>'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,</LINE>
<LINE>'That I receive the general food at first,</LINE>
<LINE>Which you do live upon; and fit it is,</LINE>
<LINE>Because I am the store-house and the shop</LINE>
<LINE>Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,</LINE>
<LINE>I send it through the rivers of your blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;</LINE>
<LINE>And, through the cranks and offices of man,</LINE>
<LINE>The strongest nerves and small inferior veins</LINE>
<LINE>From me receive that natural competency</LINE>
<LINE>Whereby they live: and though that all at once,</LINE>
<LINE>You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir; well, well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Though all at once cannot</LINE>
<LINE>See what I do deliver out to each,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet I can make my audit up, that all</LINE>
<LINE>From me do back receive the flour of all,</LINE>
<LINE>And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was an answer: how apply you this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The senators of Rome are this good belly,</LINE>
<LINE>And you the mutinous members; for examine</LINE>
<LINE>Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly</LINE>
<LINE>Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find</LINE>
<LINE>No public benefit which you receive</LINE>
<LINE>But it proceeds or comes from them to you</LINE>
<LINE>And no way from yourselves. What do you think,</LINE>
<LINE>You, the great toe of this assembly?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I the great toe! why the great toe?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,</LINE>
<LINE>Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,</LINE>
<LINE>Lead'st first to win some vantage.</LINE>
<LINE>But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:</LINE>
<LINE>Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;</LINE>
<LINE>The one side must have bale.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter CAIUS MARCIUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Hail, noble Marcius!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,</LINE>
<LINE>That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,</LINE>
<LINE>Make yourselves scabs?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have ever your good word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that will give good words to thee will flatter</LINE>
<LINE>Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,</LINE>
<LINE>That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,</LINE>
<LINE>The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,</LINE>
<LINE>Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;</LINE>
<LINE>Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,</LINE>
<LINE>Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,</LINE>
<LINE>Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is</LINE>
<LINE>To make him worthy whose offence subdues him</LINE>
<LINE>And curse that justice did it.</LINE>
<LINE>Who deserves greatness</LINE>
<LINE>Deserves your hate; and your affections are</LINE>
<LINE>A sick man's appetite, who desires most that</LINE>
<LINE>Which would increase his evil. He that depends</LINE>
<LINE>Upon your favours swims with fins of lead</LINE>
<LINE>And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?</LINE>
<LINE>With every minute you do change a mind,</LINE>
<LINE>And call him noble that was now your hate,</LINE>
<LINE>Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,</LINE>
<LINE>That in these several places of the city</LINE>
<LINE>You cry against the noble senate, who,</LINE>
<LINE>Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else</LINE>
<LINE>Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,</LINE>
<LINE>The city is well stored.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hang 'em! They say!</LINE>
<LINE>They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know</LINE>
<LINE>What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,</LINE>
<LINE>Who thrives and who declines; side factions</LINE>
<LINE>and give out</LINE>
<LINE>Conjectural marriages; making parties strong</LINE>
<LINE>And feebling such as stand not in their liking</LINE>
<LINE>Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's</LINE>
<LINE>grain enough!</LINE>
<LINE>Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,</LINE>
<LINE>And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry</LINE>
<LINE>With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high</LINE>
<LINE>As I could pick my lance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;</LINE>
<LINE>For though abundantly they lack discretion,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,</LINE>
<LINE>What says the other troop?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are dissolved: hang 'em!</LINE>
<LINE>They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,</LINE>
<LINE>That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,</LINE>
<LINE>That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not</LINE>
<LINE>Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds</LINE>
<LINE>They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,</LINE>
<LINE>And a petition granted them, a strange one--</LINE>
<LINE>To break the heart of generosity,</LINE>
<LINE>And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps</LINE>
<LINE>As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,</LINE>
<LINE>Shouting their emulation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is granted them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,</LINE>
<LINE>Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,</LINE>
<LINE>Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!</LINE>
<LINE>The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time</LINE>
<LINE>Win upon power and throw forth greater themes</LINE>
<LINE>For insurrection's arguing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is strange.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, get you home, you fragments!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger, hastily</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where's Caius Marcius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here: what's the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent</LINE>
<LINE>Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators;
JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;</LINE>
<LINE>The Volsces are in arms.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They have a leader,</LINE>
<LINE>Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.</LINE>
<LINE>I sin in envying his nobility,</LINE>
<LINE>And were I any thing but what I am,</LINE>
<LINE>I would wish me only he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have fought together.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were half to half the world by the ears and he.</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make</LINE>
<LINE>Only my wars with him: he is a lion</LINE>
<LINE>That I am proud to hunt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, worthy Marcius,</LINE>
<LINE>Attend upon Cominius to these wars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is your former promise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, it is;</LINE>
<LINE>And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou</LINE>
<LINE>Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.</LINE>
<LINE>What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TITUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, Caius Marcius;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere stay behind this business.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, true-bred!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TITUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To COMINIUS</STAGEDIR>                Lead you on.</LINE>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To MARCIUS</STAGEDIR>  Follow Cominius; we must follow you;</LINE>
<LINE>Right worthy you priority.</LINE>

<LINE><STAGEDIR>To the Citizens</STAGEDIR>  Hence to your homes; be gone!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, let them follow:</LINE>
<LINE>The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither</LINE>
<LINE>To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,</LINE>
<LINE>Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Citizens steal away. Exeunt all but SICINIUS
and BRUTUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He has no equal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mark'd you his lip and eyes?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay. but his taunts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be-mock the modest moon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The present wars devour him: he is grown</LINE>
<LINE>Too proud to be so valiant.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Such a nature,</LINE>
<LINE>Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow</LINE>
<LINE>Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, your opinion is, Aufidius,</LINE>
<LINE>That they of Rome are entered in our counsels</LINE>
<LINE>And know how we proceed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it not yours?</LINE>
<LINE>What ever have been thought on in this state,</LINE>
<LINE>That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome</LINE>
<LINE>Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone</LINE>
<LINE>Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think</LINE>
<LINE>I have the letter here; yes, here it is.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>'They have press'd a power, but it is not known</LINE>
<LINE>Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;</LINE>
<LINE>The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,</LINE>
<LINE>Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,</LINE>
<LINE>And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,</LINE>
<LINE>These three lead on this preparation</LINE>

<LINE>Our army's in the field</LINE>
<LINE>We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready</LINE>
<LINE>To answer us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor did you think it folly</LINE>
<LINE>To keep your great pretences veil'd till when</LINE>
<LINE>They needs must show themselves; which</LINE>
<LINE>in the hatching,</LINE>
<LINE>It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.</LINE>
<LINE>We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was</LINE>

<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, doubt not that;</LINE>
<LINE>I speak from certainties. Nay, more,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a</LINE>
<LINE>more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I</LINE>
<LINE>should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he</LINE>
<LINE>won honour than in the embracements of his bed where</LINE>
<LINE>he would show most love. When yet he was but</LINE>
<LINE>tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when</LINE>
<LINE>youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when</LINE>
<LINE>for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not</LINE>
<LINE>sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering</LINE>
<LINE>how honour would become such a person. that it was</LINE>
<LINE>no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if</LINE>
<LINE>renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek</LINE>
<LINE>danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel</LINE>
<LINE>war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows</LINE>
<LINE>bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not</LINE>
<LINE>more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child</LINE>
<LINE>than now in first seeing he had proved himself a</LINE>
<LINE>man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIRGILIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But had he died in the business, madam; how then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then his good report should have been my son; I</LINE>
<LINE>therein would have found issue. Hear me profess</LINE>
<LINE>sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love</LINE>
<LINE>alike and none less dear than thine and my good</LINE>
<LINE>Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, you shall not.</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,</LINE>
<LINE>See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,</LINE>
<LINE>As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:</LINE>
<LINE>'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,</LINE>
<LINE>Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow</LINE>
<LINE>With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow</LINE>
<LINE>Or all or lose his hire.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIRGILIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away, you fool! it more becomes a man</LINE>
<LINE>Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,</LINE>
<LINE>When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier</LINE>
<LINE>Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood</LINE>
<LINE>At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,</LINE>
<LINE>We are fit to bid her welcome.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VALERIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a</LINE>
<LINE>very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'</LINE>
<LINE>Wednesday half an hour together: has such a</LINE>
<LINE>confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded</LINE>
<LINE>butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go</LINE>
<LINE>again; and after it again; and over and over he</LINE>
<LINE>comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his</LINE>
<LINE>fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his</LINE>
<LINE>teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked</LINE>
<LINE>it!</LINE>

<LINE>Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIRGILIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, I pray you?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>VIRGILIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>VALERIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all</LINE>
<LINE>the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill</LINE>
<LINE>Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric</LINE>
<LINE>were sensible as your finger, that you might leave</LINE>
<LINE>pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIRGILIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.</LINE>

<LINE>In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you</LINE>

<LINE>O, good madam, there can be none yet.</LINE>

<LINE>Indeed, madam?</LINE>

<LINE>down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt</LINE>

<LINE>on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>VIRGILIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Drums afar off</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Hark! our drums</LINE>
<LINE>Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,</LINE>
<LINE>Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,</LINE>
<LINE>Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;</LINE>

<LINE>They fear us not, but issue forth their city.</LINE>
<LINE>Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight</LINE>
<LINE>With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,</LINE>
<LINE>brave Titus:</LINE>
<LINE>They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:</LINE>

<LINE>Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd</LINE>
<LINE>Further than seen and one infect another</LINE>
<LINE>Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,</LINE>
<LINE>That bear the shapes of men, how have you run</LINE>
<LINE>From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!</LINE>
<LINE>All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale</LINE>
<LINE>With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,</LINE>
<LINE>Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe</LINE>
<LINE>And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;</LINE>
<LINE>If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,</LINE>
<LINE>As they us to our trenches followed.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Another alarum. The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS
follows them to the gates</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>I saw our party to their trenches driven,</LINE>
<LINE>And then I came away.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Though thou speak'st truth,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Above an hour, my lord.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:</LINE>
<LINE>How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,</LINE>
<LINE>And bring thy news so late?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Spies of the Volsces</LINE>
<LINE>Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel</LINE>
<LINE>Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Half an hour since brought my report.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who's yonder,</LINE>
<LINE>That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods</LINE>
<LINE>He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have</LINE>
<LINE>Before-time seen him thus.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter MARCIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come I too late?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,</LINE>
<LINE>But mantled in your own.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, let me clip ye</LINE>
<LINE>In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart</LINE>
<LINE>As merry as when our nuptial day was done,</LINE>
<LINE>And tapers burn'd to bedward!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Flower of warriors,</LINE>
<LINE>How is it with Titus Lartius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As with a man busied about decrees:</LINE>
<LINE>Condemning some to death, and some to exile;</LINE>
<LINE>Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;</LINE>
<LINE>Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,</LINE>
<LINE>To let him slip at will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is that slave</LINE>
<LINE>Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?</LINE>
<LINE>Where is he? call him hither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let him alone;</LINE>
<LINE>He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,</LINE>
<LINE>The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--</LINE>
<LINE>The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge</LINE>
<LINE>From rascals worse than they.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But how prevail'd you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.</LINE>
<LINE>Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?</LINE>
<LINE>If not, why cease you till you are so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marcius,</LINE>
<LINE>We have at disadvantage fought and did</LINE>
<LINE>Retire to win our purpose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How lies their battle? know you on which side</LINE>
<LINE>They have placed their men of trust?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As I guess, Marcius,</LINE>
<LINE>Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,</LINE>
<LINE>Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,</LINE>
<LINE>Their very heart of hope.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do beseech you,</LINE>
<LINE>By all the battles wherein we have fought,</LINE>
<LINE>By the blood we have shed together, by the vows</LINE>
<LINE>We have made to endure friends, that you directly</LINE>
<LINE>Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;</LINE>
<LINE>And that you not delay the present, but,</LINE>
<LINE>Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,</LINE>
<LINE>We prove this very hour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Though I could wish</LINE>
<LINE>You were conducted to a gentle bath</LINE>
<LINE>And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never</LINE>
<LINE>Deny your asking: take your choice of those</LINE>
<LINE>That best can aid your action.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Those are they</LINE>
<LINE>That most are willing. If any such be here--</LINE>
<LINE>As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear</LINE>
<LINE>Lesser his person than an ill report;</LINE>
<LINE>If any think brave death outweighs bad life</LINE>
<LINE>And that his country's dearer than himself;</LINE>
<LINE>Let him alone, or so many so minded,</LINE>
<LINE>Wave thus, to express his disposition,</LINE>
<LINE>And follow Marcius.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>They all shout and wave their swords, take him up in
their arms, and cast up their caps</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O, me alone! make you a sword of me?</LINE>
<LINE>If these shows be not outward, which of you</LINE>
<LINE>But is four Volsces? none of you but is</LINE>
<LINE>Able to bear against the great Aufidius</LINE>
<LINE>A shield as hard as his. A certain number,</LINE>
<LINE>Though thanks to all, must I select</LINE>
<LINE>from all: the rest</LINE>
<LINE>Shall bear the business in some other fight,</LINE>
<LINE>As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;</LINE>
<LINE>And four shall quickly draw out my command,</LINE>
<LINE>Which men are best inclined.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,</LINE>
<LINE>As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch</LINE>

<LINE>Worse than a promise-breaker.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We hate alike:</LINE>
<LINE>Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor</LINE>

<LINE>Within these three hours, Tullus,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it</LINE>
<LINE>Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,</LINE>
<LINE>Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,</LINE>
<LINE>I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,</LINE>
<LINE>And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the</LINE>
<LINE>dull tribunes,</LINE>
<LINE>That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods</LINE>
<LINE>Our Rome hath such a soldier.'</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LARTIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O general,</LINE>
<LINE>Here is the steed, we the caparison:</LINE>
<LINE>Hadst thou beheld--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray now, no more: my mother,</LINE>
<LINE>Who has a charter to extol her blood,</LINE>
<LINE>When she does praise me grieves me. I have done</LINE>
<LINE>As you have done; that's what I can; induced</LINE>
<LINE>As you have been; that's for my country:</LINE>
<LINE>He that has but effected his good will</LINE>
<LINE>Hath overta'en mine act.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall not be</LINE>
<LINE>The grave of your deserving; Rome must know</LINE>
<LINE>The value of her own: 'twere a concealment</LINE>
<LINE>Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,</LINE>
<LINE>To hide your doings; and to silence that,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you</LINE>
<LINE>In sign of what you are, not to reward</LINE>
<LINE>What you have done--before our army hear me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have some wounds upon me, and they smart</LINE>
<LINE>To hear themselves remember'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Should they not,</LINE>
<LINE>Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,</LINE>
<LINE>And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all</LINE>
<LINE>The treasure in this field achieved and city,</LINE>
<LINE>We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,</LINE>
<LINE>Before the common distribution, at</LINE>
<LINE>Your only choice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank you, general;</LINE>
<LINE>But cannot make my heart consent to take</LINE>
<LINE>A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;</LINE>
<LINE>And stand upon my common part with those</LINE>
<LINE>That have beheld the doing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius! Marcius!'
cast up their caps and lances: COMINIUS and LARTIUS
stand bare</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May these same instruments, which you profane,</LINE>
<LINE>Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall</LINE>
<LINE>I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be</LINE>
<LINE>Made all of false-faced soothing!</LINE>
<LINE>When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,</LINE>
<LINE>Let him be made a coverture for the wars!</LINE>
<LINE>No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd</LINE>
<LINE>My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--</LINE>
<LINE>Which, without note, here's many else have done,--</LINE>
<LINE>You shout me forth</LINE>
<LINE>In acclamations hyperbolical;</LINE>
<LINE>As if I loved my little should be dieted</LINE>
<LINE>In praises sauced with lies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Too modest are you;</LINE>
<LINE>More cruel to your good report than grateful</LINE>
<LINE>To us that give you truly: by your patience,</LINE>
<LINE>If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,</LINE>
<LINE>Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,</LINE>
<LINE>Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,</LINE>
<LINE>As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius</LINE>
<LINE>Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,</LINE>
<LINE>My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,</LINE>
<LINE>With all his trim belonging; and from this time,</LINE>
<LINE>For what he did before Corioli, call him,</LINE>
<LINE>With all the applause and clamour of the host,</LINE>
<LINE>CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear</LINE>
<LINE>The addition nobly ever!</LINE>

<LINE>I will go wash;</LINE>
<LINE>And when my face is fair, you shall perceive</LINE>
<LINE>Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.</LINE>
<LINE>I mean to stride your steed, and at all times</LINE>
<LINE>To undercrest your good addition</LINE>
<LINE>To the fairness of my power.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, to our tent;</LINE>
<LINE>Where, ere we do repose us, we will write</LINE>
<LINE>To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,</LINE>
<LINE>Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome</LINE>
<LINE>The best, with whom we may articulate,</LINE>
<LINE>For their own good and ours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>LARTIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The gods begin to mock me. I, that now</LINE>
<LINE>Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg</LINE>

<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I sometime lay here in Corioli</LINE>
<LINE>At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:</LINE>
<LINE>He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;</LINE>
<LINE>But then Aufidius was within my view,</LINE>
<LINE>And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you</LINE>
<LINE>To give my poor host freedom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, well begg'd!</LINE>
<LINE>Were he the butcher of my son, he should</LINE>

<LINE>I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,</LINE>
<LINE>Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!</LINE>
<LINE>What good condition can a treaty find</LINE>
<LINE>I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,</LINE>
<LINE>I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,</LINE>
<LINE>And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter</LINE>
<LINE>As often as we eat. By the elements,</LINE>
<LINE>If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,</LINE>
<LINE>He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation</LINE>
<LINE>Hath not that honour in't it had; for where</LINE>
<LINE>I thought to crush him in an equal force,</LINE>

<LINE>Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,</LINE>
<LINE>The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,</LINE>
<LINE>Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up</LINE>
<LINE>Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Both</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is strange now: do you two know how you are</LINE>
<LINE>censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the</LINE>
<LINE>right-hand file? do you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Both</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, how are we censured?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Both</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, well, sir, well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of</LINE>
<LINE>occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:</LINE>
<LINE>give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at</LINE>
<LINE>your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a</LINE>
<LINE>pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for</LINE>
<LINE>being proud?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We do it not alone, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know you can do very little alone; for your helps</LINE>
<LINE>are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous</LINE>
<LINE>single: your abilities are too infant-like for</LINE>
<LINE>doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you</LINE>
<LINE>could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,</LINE>
<LINE>and make but an interior survey of your good selves!</LINE>
<LINE>O that you could!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What then, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,</LINE>
<LINE>proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as</LINE>
<LINE>any in Rome.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Menenius, you are known well enough too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that</LINE>
<LINE>loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying</LINE>
<LINE>Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in</LINE>
<LINE>favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like</LINE>
<LINE>upon too trivial motion; one that converses more</LINE>
<LINE>with the buttock of the night than with the forehead</LINE>
<LINE>of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my</LINE>
<LINE>malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as</LINE>
<LINE>you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink</LINE>
<LINE>you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a</LINE>
<LINE>crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have</LINE>
<LINE>delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in</LINE>
<LINE>compound with the major part of your syllables: and</LINE>
<LINE>though I must be content to bear with those that say</LINE>
<LINE>you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that</LINE>
<LINE>tell you you have good faces. If you see this in</LINE>
<LINE>the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known</LINE>
<LINE>well enough too? what barm can your bisson</LINE>
<LINE>conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be</LINE>
<LINE>known well enough too?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You</LINE>
<LINE>are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you</LINE>
<LINE>wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a</LINE>
<LINE>cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;</LINE>
<LINE>and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a</LINE>
<LINE>second day of audience. When you are hearing a</LINE>
<LINE>matter between party and party, if you chance to be</LINE>
<LINE>pinched with the colic, you make faces like</LINE>
<LINE>mummers; set up the bloody flag against all</LINE>
<LINE>patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,</LINE>
<LINE>dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled</LINE>
<LINE>by your hearing: all the peace you make in their</LINE>
<LINE>cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are</LINE>
<LINE>a pair of strange ones.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, you are well understood to be a</LINE>
<LINE>perfecter giber for the table than a necessary</LINE>
<LINE>bencher in the Capitol.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall</LINE>
<LINE>encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When</LINE>
<LINE>you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the</LINE>
<LINE>wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not</LINE>
<LINE>so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's</LINE>
<LINE>cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-</LINE>
<LINE>saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;</LINE>
<LINE>who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors</LINE>
<LINE>since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the</LINE>
<LINE>best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to</LINE>
<LINE>your worships: more of your conversation would</LINE>
<LINE>infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly</LINE>
<LINE>plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,</LINE>
<LINE>were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow</LINE>
<LINE>your eyes so fast?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for</LINE>
<LINE>the love of Juno, let's go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha! Marcius coming home!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous</LINE>
<LINE>approbation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!</LINE>
<LINE>Marcius coming home!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>VIRGILIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay,'tis true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath</LINE>
<LINE>another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one</LINE>
<LINE>at home for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for</LINE>
<LINE>me!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIRGILIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven</LINE>
<LINE>years' health; in which time I will make a lip at</LINE>
<LINE>the physician: the most sovereign prescription in</LINE>
<LINE>Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,</LINE>
<LINE>of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he</LINE>
<LINE>not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIRGILIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, no, no, no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'</LINE>
<LINE>victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home</LINE>
<LINE>with the oaken garland.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but</LINE>
<LINE>Aufidius got off.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:</LINE>
<LINE>an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so</LINE>
<LINE>fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold</LINE>
<LINE>that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate</LINE>
<LINE>has letters from the general, wherein he gives my</LINE>
<LINE>son the whole name of the war: he hath in this</LINE>
<LINE>action outdone his former deeds doubly</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VALERIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his</LINE>
<LINE>true purchasing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIRGILIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The gods grant them true!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True! pow, wow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True! I'll be sworn they are true.</LINE>
<LINE>Where is he wounded?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To the Tribunes</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>God save your good worships! Marcius is coming</LINE>
<LINE>home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be</LINE>
<LINE>large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall</LINE>
<LINE>stand for his place. He received in the repulse of</LINE>
<LINE>Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's</LINE>
<LINE>nine that I know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five</LINE>
<LINE>wounds upon him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>A shout and flourish</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Hark! the trumpets.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he</LINE>
<LINE>carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:</LINE>
<LINE>Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;</LINE>
<LINE>Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the
general, and TITUS LARTIUS; between them, CORIOLANUS,
crowned with an oaken garland; with Captains and
Soldiers, and a Herald</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Herald</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight</LINE>
<LINE>Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,</LINE>
<LINE>With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these</LINE>
<LINE>In honour follows Coriolanus.</LINE>
<LINE>Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>All</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more of this; it does offend my heart:</LINE>
<LINE>Pray now, no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look, sir, your mother!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O,</LINE>
<LINE>You have, I know, petition'd all the gods</LINE>
<LINE>For my prosperity!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Kneels</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, my good soldier, up;</LINE>
<LINE>My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and</LINE>
<LINE>By deed-achieving honour newly named,--</LINE>
<LINE>What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--</LINE>
<LINE>But O, thy wife!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My gracious silence, hail!</LINE>
<LINE>Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,</LINE>
<LINE>That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,</LINE>
<LINE>Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,</LINE>
<LINE>And mothers that lack sons.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, the gods crown thee!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And live you yet?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To VALERIA</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O my sweet lady, pardon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:</LINE>
<LINE>And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep</LINE>
<LINE>And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.</LINE>
<LINE>A curse begin at very root on's heart,</LINE>
<LINE>That is not glad to see thee! You are three</LINE>
<LINE>That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,</LINE>
<LINE>We have some old crab-trees here</LINE>
<LINE>at home that will not</LINE>
<LINE>Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:</LINE>
<LINE>We call a nettle but a nettle and</LINE>
<LINE>The faults of fools but folly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ever right.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Menenius ever, ever.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Herald</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give way there, and go on!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA</STAGEDIR>  Your hand, and yours:</LINE>
<LINE>Ere in our own house I do shade my head,</LINE>
<LINE>The good patricians must be visited;</LINE>
<LINE>From whom I have received not only greetings,</LINE>
<LINE>But with them change of honours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have lived</LINE>
<LINE>To see inherited my very wishes</LINE>
<LINE>And the buildings of my fancy: only</LINE>
<LINE>There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but</LINE>
<LINE>Our Rome will cast upon thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know, good mother,</LINE>
<LINE>I had rather be their servant in my way,</LINE>
<LINE>Than sway with them in theirs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>On, to the Capitol!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state, as before.
BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights</LINE>
<LINE>Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse</LINE>
<LINE>Into a rapture lets her baby cry</LINE>
<LINE>While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins</LINE>
<LINE>Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,</LINE>
<LINE>Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,</LINE>
<LINE>Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed</LINE>
<LINE>With variable complexions, all agreeing</LINE>
<LINE>In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens</LINE>
<LINE>Do press among the popular throngs and puff</LINE>
<LINE>To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames</LINE>
<LINE>Commit the war of white and damask in</LINE>
<LINE>Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil</LINE>
<LINE>Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother</LINE>
<LINE>As if that whatsoever god who leads him</LINE>
<LINE>Were slily crept into his human powers</LINE>
<LINE>And gave him graceful posture.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>On the sudden,</LINE>
<LINE>I warrant him consul.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then our office may,</LINE>
<LINE>During his power, go sleep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He cannot temperately transport his honours</LINE>
<LINE>From where he should begin and end, but will</LINE>
<LINE>Lose those he hath won.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In that there's comfort.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Doubt not</LINE>
<LINE>The commoners, for whom we stand, but they</LINE>
<LINE>Upon their ancient malice will forget</LINE>
<LINE>With the least cause these his new honours, which</LINE>
<LINE>That he will give them make I as little question</LINE>
<LINE>As he is proud to do't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I heard him swear,</LINE>
<LINE>Were he to stand for consul, never would he</LINE>
<LINE>Appear i' the market-place nor on him put</LINE>
<LINE>The napless vesture of humility;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds</LINE>
<LINE>To the people, beg their stinking breaths.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis right.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was his word: O, he would miss it rather</LINE>
<LINE>Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,</LINE>
<LINE>And the desire of the nobles.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wish no better</LINE>
<LINE>Than have him hold that purpose and to put it</LINE>
<LINE>In execution.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis most like he will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It shall be to him then as our good wills,</LINE>
<LINE>A sure destruction.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So it must fall out</LINE>
<LINE>To him or our authorities. For an end,</LINE>
<LINE>We must suggest the people in what hatred</LINE>
<LINE>He still hath held them; that to's power he would</LINE>
<LINE>Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and</LINE>
<LINE>Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,</LINE>
<LINE>In human action and capacity,</LINE>
<LINE>Of no more soul nor fitness for the world</LINE>
<LINE>Than camels in the war, who have their provand</LINE>
<LINE>Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows</LINE>
<LINE>For sinking under them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This, as you say, suggested</LINE>
<LINE>At some time when his soaring insolence</LINE>
<LINE>Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,</LINE>
<LINE>If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy</LINE>
<LINE>As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire</LINE>
<LINE>To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze</LINE>
<LINE>Shall darken him for ever.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought</LINE>
<LINE>That Marcius shall be consul:</LINE>
<LINE>I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and</LINE>
<LINE>The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,</LINE>
<LINE>Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,</LINE>
<LINE>As to Jove's statue, and the commons made</LINE>
<LINE>A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:</LINE>
<LINE>I never saw the like.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let's to the Capitol;</LINE>
<LINE>And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,</LINE>
<LINE>But hearts for the event.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE  II.  The same. The Capitol.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter two Officers, to lay cushions</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Officer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand</LINE>
<LINE>for consulships?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Officer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one</LINE>
<LINE>Coriolanus will carry it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Officer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and</LINE>
<LINE>loves not the common people.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Officer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, there had been many great men that have</LINE>
<LINE>flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there</LINE>
<LINE>be many that they have loved, they know not</LINE>
<LINE>wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,</LINE>
<LINE>they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for</LINE>
<LINE>Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate</LINE>
<LINE>him manifests the true knowledge he has in their</LINE>
<LINE>disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets</LINE>
<LINE>them plainly see't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Officer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he did not care whether he had their love or no,</LINE>
<LINE>he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither</LINE>
<LINE>good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater</LINE>
<LINE>devotion than can render it him; and leaves</LINE>
<LINE>nothing undone that may fully discover him their</LINE>
<LINE>opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and</LINE>
<LINE>displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he</LINE>
<LINE>dislikes, to flatter them for their love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Officer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his</LINE>
<LINE>ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,</LINE>
<LINE>having been supple and courteous to the people,</LINE>
<LINE>bonneted, without any further deed to have them at</LINE>
<LINE>an into their estimation and report: but he hath so</LINE>
<LINE>planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions</LINE>
<LINE>in their hearts, that for their tongues to be</LINE>
<LINE>silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of</LINE>
<LINE>ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a</LINE>
<LINE>malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck</LINE>
<LINE>reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Officer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they</LINE>
<LINE>are coming.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>A sennet. Enter, with actors before them, COMINIUS
the consul, MENENIUS, CORIOLANUS, Senators,
SICINIUS and BRUTUS. The Senators take their
places; the Tribunes take their Places by
themselves. CORIOLANUS stands</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Having determined of the Volsces and</LINE>
<LINE>To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,</LINE>
<LINE>As the main point of this our after-meeting,</LINE>
<LINE>To gratify his noble service that</LINE>
<LINE>Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,</LINE>
<LINE>please you,</LINE>
<LINE>Most reverend and grave elders, to desire</LINE>
<LINE>The present consul, and last general</LINE>
<LINE>In our well-found successes, to report</LINE>
<LINE>A little of that worthy work perform'd</LINE>
<LINE>By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom</LINE>
<LINE>We met here both to thank and to remember</LINE>
<LINE>With honours like himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak, good Cominius:</LINE>
<LINE>Leave nothing out for length, and make us think</LINE>
<LINE>Rather our state's defective for requital</LINE>
<LINE>Than we to stretch it out.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To the Tribunes</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Masters o' the people,</LINE>
<LINE>We do request your kindest ears, and after,</LINE>
<LINE>Your loving motion toward the common body,</LINE>
<LINE>To yield what passes here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are convented</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts</LINE>
<LINE>Inclinable to honour and advance</LINE>
<LINE>The theme of our assembly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which the rather</LINE>
<LINE>We shall be blest to do, if he remember</LINE>
<LINE>A kinder value of the people than</LINE>
<LINE>He hath hereto prized them at.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's off, that's off;</LINE>
<LINE>I would you rather had been silent. Please you</LINE>
<LINE>To hear Cominius speak?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most willingly;</LINE>
<LINE>But yet my caution was more pertinent</LINE>
<LINE>Than the rebuke you give it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He loves your people</LINE>
<LINE>But tie him not to be their bedfellow.</LINE>
<LINE>Worthy Cominius, speak.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>CORIOLANUS offers to go away</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Nay, keep your place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear</LINE>
<LINE>What you have nobly done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your horror's pardon:</LINE>
<LINE>I had rather have my wounds to heal again</LINE>
<LINE>Than hear say how I got them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I hope</LINE>
<LINE>My words disbench'd you not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sir: yet oft,</LINE>
<LINE>When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.</LINE>
<LINE>You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but</LINE>
<LINE>your people,</LINE>
<LINE>I love them as they weigh.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray now, sit down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun</LINE>
<LINE>When the alarum were struck than idly sit</LINE>
<LINE>To hear my nothings monster'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Masters of the people,</LINE>
<LINE>Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--</LINE>
<LINE>That's thousand to one good one--when you now see</LINE>
<LINE>He had rather venture all his limbs for honour</LINE>
<LINE>Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus</LINE>
<LINE>Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held</LINE>
<LINE>That valour is the chiefest virtue, and</LINE>
<LINE>Most dignifies the haver: if it be,</LINE>
<LINE>The man I speak of cannot in the world</LINE>
<LINE>Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,</LINE>
<LINE>When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,</LINE>
<LINE>When with his Amazonian chin he drove</LINE>
<LINE>The bristled lips before him: be bestrid</LINE>
<LINE>An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view</LINE>
<LINE>Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,</LINE>
<LINE>And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,</LINE>
<LINE>When he might act the woman in the scene,</LINE>
<LINE>He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed</LINE>
<LINE>Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age</LINE>
<LINE>Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,</LINE>
<LINE>And in the brunt of seventeen battles since</LINE>
<LINE>He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,</LINE>
<LINE>Before and in Corioli, let me say,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;</LINE>
<LINE>And by his rare example made the coward</LINE>
<LINE>Turn terror into sport: as weeds before</LINE>
<LINE>A vessel under sail, so men obey'd</LINE>
<LINE>And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,</LINE>
<LINE>Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot</LINE>
<LINE>He was a thing of blood, whose every motion</LINE>
<LINE>Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd</LINE>
<LINE>The mortal gate of the city, which he painted</LINE>
<LINE>With shunless destiny; aidless came off,</LINE>
<LINE>And with a sudden reinforcement struck</LINE>
<LINE>Corioli like a planet: now all's his:</LINE>
<LINE>When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce</LINE>
<LINE>His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit</LINE>
<LINE>Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,</LINE>
<LINE>And to the battle came he; where he did</LINE>
<LINE>Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if</LINE>
<LINE>'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd</LINE>
<LINE>Both field and city ours, he never stood</LINE>
<LINE>To ease his breast with panting.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Worthy man!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He cannot but with measure fit the honours</LINE>
<LINE>Which we devise him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our spoils he kick'd at,</LINE>
<LINE>And look'd upon things precious as they were</LINE>
<LINE>The common muck of the world: he covets less</LINE>
<LINE>Than misery itself would give; rewards</LINE>
<LINE>His deeds with doing them, and is content</LINE>
<LINE>To spend the time to end it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He's right noble:</LINE>
<LINE>Let him be call'd for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call Coriolanus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Officer</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He doth appear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter CORIOLANUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased</LINE>
<LINE>To make thee consul.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do owe them still</LINE>
<LINE>My life and services.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It then remains</LINE>
<LINE>That you do speak to the people.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do beseech you,</LINE>
<LINE>Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot</LINE>
<LINE>Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,</LINE>
<LINE>For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you</LINE>
<LINE>That I may pass this doing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, the people</LINE>
<LINE>Must have their voices; neither will they bate</LINE>
<LINE>One jot of ceremony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Put them not to't:</LINE>
<LINE>Pray you, go fit you to the custom and</LINE>
<LINE>Take to you, as your predecessors have,</LINE>
<LINE>Your honour with your form.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is apart</LINE>
<LINE>That I shall blush in acting, and might well</LINE>
<LINE>Be taken from the people.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mark you that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;</LINE>
<LINE>Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,</LINE>
<LINE>As if I had received them for the hire</LINE>
<LINE>Of their breath only!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not stand upon't.</LINE>
<LINE>We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,</LINE>
<LINE>Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul</LINE>
<LINE>Wish we all joy and honour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Senators</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish of cornets. Exeunt all but SICINIUS
and BRUTUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You see how he intends to use the people.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May they perceive's intent! He will require them,</LINE>
<LINE>As if he did contemn what he requested</LINE>
<LINE>Should be in them to give.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, we'll inform them</LINE>
<LINE>Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,</LINE>
<LINE>I know, they do attend us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE III.  The same. The Forum.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter seven or eight Citizens</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We may, sir, if we will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a</LINE>
<LINE>power that we have no power to do; for if he show us</LINE>
<LINE>his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our</LINE>
<LINE>tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if</LINE>
<LINE>he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him</LINE>
<LINE>our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is</LINE>
<LINE>monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,</LINE>
<LINE>were to make a monster of the multitude: of the</LINE>
<LINE>which we being members, should bring ourselves to be</LINE>
<LINE>monstrous members.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And to make us no better thought of, a little help</LINE>
<LINE>will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he</LINE>
<LINE>himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have been called so of many; not that our heads</LINE>
<LINE>are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,</LINE>
<LINE>but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and</LINE>
<LINE>truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of</LINE>
<LINE>one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,</LINE>
<LINE>and their consent of one direct way should be at</LINE>
<LINE>once to all the points o' the compass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would</LINE>
<LINE>fly?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's</LINE>
<LINE>will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but</LINE>
<LINE>if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why that way?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts</LINE>
<LINE>melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return</LINE>
<LINE>for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you all resolved to give your voices? But</LINE>
<LINE>that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I</LINE>
<LINE>say, if he would incline to the people, there was</LINE>
<LINE>never a worthier man.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter CORIOLANUS in a gown of humility, with MENENIUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his</LINE>
<LINE>behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to</LINE>
<LINE>come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and</LINE>
<LINE>by threes. He's to make his requests by</LINE>
<LINE>particulars; wherein every one of us has a single</LINE>
<LINE>honour, in giving him our own voices with our own</LINE>
<LINE>tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how</LINE>
<LINE>you shall go by him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>All</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Content, content.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Citizens</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O sir, you are not right: have you not known</LINE>
<LINE>The worthiest men have done't?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What must I say?</LINE>
<LINE>'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring</LINE>
<LINE>My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!</LINE>
<LINE>I got them in my country's service, when</LINE>
<LINE>Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran</LINE>
<LINE>From the noise of our own drums.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O me, the gods!</LINE>
<LINE>You must not speak of that: you must desire them</LINE>
<LINE>To think upon you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Think upon me! hang 'em!</LINE>
<LINE>I would they would forget me, like the virtues</LINE>
<LINE>Which our divines lose by 'em.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You'll mar all:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,</LINE>
<LINE>In wholesome manner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bid them wash their faces</LINE>
<LINE>And keep their teeth clean.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter two of the Citizens</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>So, here comes a brace.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter a third Citizen</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>You know the cause, air, of my standing here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mine own desert.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your own desert!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but not mine own desire.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How not your own desire?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the</LINE>
<LINE>poor with begging.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to</LINE>
<LINE>gain by you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The price is to ask it kindly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to</LINE>
<LINE>show you, which shall be yours in private. Your</LINE>
<LINE>good voice, sir; what say you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall ha' it, worthy sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices</LINE>
<LINE>begged. I have your alms: adieu.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But this is something odd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt the three Citizens</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter two other Citizens</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your</LINE>
<LINE>voices that I may be consul, I have here the</LINE>
<LINE>customary gown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Fourth Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have deserved nobly of your country, and you</LINE>
<LINE>have not deserved nobly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your enigma?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Fourth Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have</LINE>
<LINE>been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved</LINE>
<LINE>the common people.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You should account me the more virtuous that I have</LINE>
<LINE>not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my</LINE>
<LINE>sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer</LINE>
<LINE>estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account</LINE>
<LINE>gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is</LINE>
<LINE>rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise</LINE>
<LINE>the insinuating nod and be off to them most</LINE>
<LINE>counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the</LINE>
<LINE>bewitchment of some popular man and give it</LINE>
<LINE>bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,</LINE>
<LINE>I may be consul.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Fifth Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give</LINE>
<LINE>you our voices heartily.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Fourth Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have received many wounds for your country.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I</LINE>
<LINE>will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Both Citizens</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most sweet voices!</LINE>
<LINE>Better it is to die, better to starve,</LINE>
<LINE>Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.</LINE>
<LINE>Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,</LINE>
<LINE>To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,</LINE>
<LINE>Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:</LINE>
<LINE>What custom wills, in all things should we do't,</LINE>
<LINE>The dust on antique time would lie unswept,</LINE>
<LINE>And mountainous error be too highly heapt</LINE>
<LINE>For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,</LINE>
<LINE>Let the high office and the honour go</LINE>
<LINE>To one that would do thus. I am half through;</LINE>
<LINE>The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter three Citizens more</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Here come more voices.</LINE>
<LINE>Your voices: for your voices I have fought;</LINE>
<LINE>Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear</LINE>
<LINE>Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six</LINE>
<LINE>I have seen and heard of; for your voices have</LINE>
<LINE>Done many things, some less, some more your voices:</LINE>
<LINE>Indeed I would be consul.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Sixth Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest</LINE>
<LINE>man's voice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Seventh Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,</LINE>
<LINE>and make him good friend to the people!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>All Citizens</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Worthy voices!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter MENENIUS, with BRUTUS and SICINIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes</LINE>
<LINE>Endue you with the people's voice: remains</LINE>
<LINE>That, in the official marks invested, you</LINE>
<LINE>Anon do meet the senate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is this done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The custom of request you have discharged:</LINE>
<LINE>The people do admit you, and are summon'd</LINE>
<LINE>To meet anon, upon your approbation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where? at the senate-house?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There, Coriolanus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May I change these garments?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,</LINE>
<LINE>Repair to the senate-house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll keep you company. Will you along?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We stay here for the people.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fare you well.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>He has it now, and by his looks methink</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis warm at 's heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.</LINE>
<LINE>will you dismiss the people?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter Citizens</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, my masters! have you chose this man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He has our voices, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,</LINE>
<LINE>He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Certainly</LINE>
<LINE>He flouted us downright.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says</LINE>
<LINE>He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us</LINE>
<LINE>His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, so he did, I am sure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Citizens</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no; no man saw 'em.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He said he had wounds, which he could show</LINE>
<LINE>in private;</LINE>
<LINE>And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,</LINE>
<LINE>'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,</LINE>
<LINE>But by your voices, will not so permit me;</LINE>
<LINE>Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,</LINE>
<LINE>Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:</LINE>
<LINE>Your most sweet voices: now you have left</LINE>
<LINE>your voices,</LINE>
<LINE>I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why either were you ignorant to see't,</LINE>
<LINE>Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness</LINE>
<LINE>To yield your voices?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Could you not have told him</LINE>
<LINE>As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,</LINE>
<LINE>But was a petty servant to the state,</LINE>
<LINE>He was your enemy, ever spake against</LINE>
<LINE>Your liberties and the charters that you bear</LINE>
<LINE>I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving</LINE>
<LINE>A place of potency and sway o' the state,</LINE>
<LINE>If he should still malignantly remain</LINE>
<LINE>Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might</LINE>
<LINE>Be curses to yourselves? You should have said</LINE>
<LINE>That as his worthy deeds did claim no less</LINE>
<LINE>Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature</LINE>
<LINE>Would think upon you for your voices and</LINE>
<LINE>Translate his malice towards you into love,</LINE>
<LINE>Standing your friendly lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus to have said,</LINE>
<LINE>As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit</LINE>
<LINE>And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd</LINE>
<LINE>Either his gracious promise, which you might,</LINE>
<LINE>As cause had call'd you up, have held him to</LINE>
<LINE>Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,</LINE>
<LINE>Which easily endures not article</LINE>
<LINE>Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,</LINE>
<LINE>You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler</LINE>
<LINE>And pass'd him unelected.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did you perceive</LINE>
<LINE>He did solicit you in free contempt</LINE>
<LINE>When he did need your loves, and do you think</LINE>
<LINE>That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,</LINE>
<LINE>When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies</LINE>
<LINE>No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry</LINE>
<LINE>Against the rectorship of judgment?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you</LINE>
<LINE>Ere now denied the asker? and now again</LINE>
<LINE>Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow</LINE>
<LINE>Your sued-for tongues?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And will deny him:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,</LINE>
<LINE>They have chose a consul that will from them take</LINE>
<LINE>Their liberties; make them of no more voice</LINE>
<LINE>Than dogs that are as often beat for barking</LINE>
<LINE>As therefore kept to do so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let them assemble,</LINE>
<LINE>And on a safer judgment all revoke</LINE>
<LINE>Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,</LINE>
<LINE>And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not</LINE>
<LINE>With what contempt he wore the humble weed,</LINE>
<LINE>How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,</LINE>
<LINE>Thinking upon his services, took from you</LINE>
<LINE>The apprehension of his present portance,</LINE>
<LINE>Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion</LINE>
<LINE>After the inveterate hate he bears you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lay</LINE>
<LINE>A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,</LINE>
<LINE>No impediment between, but that you must</LINE>
<LINE>Cast your election on him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, you chose him</LINE>
<LINE>More after our commandment than as guided</LINE>
<LINE>By your own true affections, and that your minds,</LINE>
<LINE>Preoccupied with what you rather must do</LINE>
<LINE>Than what you should, made you against the grain</LINE>
<LINE>To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.</LINE>
<LINE>How youngly he began to serve his country,</LINE>
<LINE>How long continued, and what stock he springs of,</LINE>
<LINE>The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came</LINE>
<LINE>That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;</LINE>
<LINE>Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,</LINE>
<LINE>That our beat water brought by conduits hither;</LINE>
<LINE>And  <STAGEDIR>Censorinus,</STAGEDIR>  nobly named so,</LINE>
<LINE>Twice being  <STAGEDIR>by the people chosen</STAGEDIR>  censor,</LINE>
<LINE>Was his great ancestor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One thus descended,</LINE>
<LINE>That hath beside well in his person wrought</LINE>
<LINE>To be set high in place, we did commend</LINE>
<LINE>To your remembrances: but you have found,</LINE>
<LINE>Scaling his present bearing with his past,</LINE>
<LINE>That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke</LINE>
<LINE>Your sudden approbation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, you ne'er had done't--</LINE>
<LINE>Harp on that still--but by our putting on;</LINE>
<LINE>And presently, when you have drawn your number,</LINE>
<LINE>Repair to the Capitol.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>All</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We will so: almost all</LINE>
<LINE>Repent in their election.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Citizens</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let them go on;</LINE>
<LINE>This mutiny were better put in hazard,</LINE>
<LINE>Than stay, past doubt, for greater:</LINE>
<LINE>If, as his nature is, he fall in rage</LINE>
<LINE>With their refusal, both observe and answer</LINE>
<LINE>The vantage of his anger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To the Capitol, come:</LINE>
<LINE>We will be there before the stream o' the people;</LINE>
<LINE>And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,</LINE>
<LINE>Which we have goaded onward.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Cornets. Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LARTIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He had, my lord; and that it was which caused</LINE>
<LINE>Our swifter composition.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So then the Volsces stand but as at first,</LINE>
<LINE>Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.</LINE>
<LINE>Upon's again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are worn, lord consul, so,</LINE>
<LINE>That we shall hardly in our ages see</LINE>
<LINE>Their banners wave again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Saw you Aufidius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LARTIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse</LINE>
<LINE>Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely</LINE>
<LINE>Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Spoke he of me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LARTIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He did, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How? what?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LARTIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How often he had met you, sword to sword;</LINE>
<LINE>That of all things upon the earth he hated</LINE>
<LINE>Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes</LINE>
<LINE>To hopeless restitution, so he might</LINE>
<LINE>Be call'd your vanquisher.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At Antium lives he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LARTIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At Antium.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wish I had a cause to seek him there,</LINE>
<LINE>To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,</LINE>
<LINE>The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;</LINE>
<LINE>For they do prank them in authority,</LINE>
<LINE>Against all noble sufferance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pass no further.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha! what is that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It will be dangerous to go on: no further.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What makes this change?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cominius, no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have I had children's voices?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The people are incensed against him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stop,</LINE>
<LINE>Or all will fall in broil.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are these your herd?</LINE>
<LINE>Must these have voices, that can yield them now</LINE>
<LINE>And straight disclaim their tongues? What are</LINE>
<LINE>your offices?</LINE>
<LINE>You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?</LINE>
<LINE>Have you not set them on?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be calm, be calm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,</LINE>
<LINE>To curb the will of the nobility:</LINE>
<LINE>Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule</LINE>
<LINE>Nor ever will be ruled.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call't not a plot:</LINE>
<LINE>The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,</LINE>
<LINE>When corn was given them gratis, you repined;</LINE>
<LINE>Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them</LINE>
<LINE>Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, this was known before.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not to them all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you inform'd them sithence?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How! I inform them!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are like to do such business.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not unlike,</LINE>
<LINE>Each way, to better yours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,</LINE>
<LINE>Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me</LINE>
<LINE>Your fellow tribune.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You show too much of that</LINE>
<LINE>For which the people stir: if you will pass</LINE>
<LINE>To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,</LINE>
<LINE>Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>Or never be so noble as a consul,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor yoke with him for tribune.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let's be calm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The people are abused; set on. This paltering</LINE>
<LINE>Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus</LINE>
<LINE>Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely</LINE>
<LINE>I' the plain way of his merit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell me of corn!</LINE>
<LINE>This was my speech, and I will speak't again--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not now, not now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not in this heat, sir, now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,</LINE>
<LINE>I crave their pardons:</LINE>
<LINE>For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them</LINE>
<LINE>Regard me as I do not flatter, and</LINE>
<LINE>Therein behold themselves: I say again,</LINE>
<LINE>In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate</LINE>
<LINE>The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,</LINE>
<LINE>Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,</LINE>
<LINE>and scatter'd,</LINE>
<LINE>By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,</LINE>
<LINE>Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that</LINE>
<LINE>Which they have given to beggars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more words, we beseech you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How! no more!</LINE>
<LINE>As for my country I have shed my blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs</LINE>
<LINE>Coin words till their decay against those measles,</LINE>
<LINE>Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought</LINE>
<LINE>The very way to catch them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You speak o' the people,</LINE>
<LINE>As if you were a god to punish, not</LINE>
<LINE>A man of their infirmity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Twere well</LINE>
<LINE>We let the people know't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, what? his choler?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Choler!</LINE>
<LINE>Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>By Jove, 'twould be my mind!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is a mind</LINE>
<LINE>That shall remain a poison where it is,</LINE>
<LINE>Not poison any further.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall remain!</LINE>
<LINE>Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you</LINE>
<LINE>His absolute 'shall'?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Twas from the canon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Shall'!</LINE>
<LINE>O good but most unwise patricians! why,</LINE>
<LINE>You grave but reckless senators, have you thus</LINE>
<LINE>Given Hydra here to choose an officer,</LINE>
<LINE>That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but</LINE>
<LINE>The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit</LINE>
<LINE>To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,</LINE>
<LINE>And make your channel his? If he have power</LINE>
<LINE>Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake</LINE>
<LINE>Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Be not as common fools; if you are not,</LINE>
<LINE>Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,</LINE>
<LINE>If they be senators: and they are no less,</LINE>
<LINE>When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste</LINE>
<LINE>Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,</LINE>
<LINE>And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'</LINE>
<LINE>His popular 'shall' against a graver bench</LINE>
<LINE>Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!</LINE>
<LINE>It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches</LINE>
<LINE>To know, when two authorities are up,</LINE>
<LINE>Neither supreme, how soon confusion</LINE>
<LINE>May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take</LINE>
<LINE>The one by the other.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, on to the market-place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth</LINE>
<LINE>The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used</LINE>
<LINE>Sometime in Greece,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, well, no more of that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Though there the people had more absolute power,</LINE>
<LINE>I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed</LINE>
<LINE>The ruin of the state.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, shall the people give</LINE>
<LINE>One that speaks thus their voice?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll give my reasons,</LINE>
<LINE>More worthier than their voices. They know the corn</LINE>
<LINE>Was not our recompense, resting well assured</LINE>
<LINE>That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,</LINE>
<LINE>Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,</LINE>
<LINE>They would not thread the gates. This kind of service</LINE>
<LINE>Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war</LINE>
<LINE>Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd</LINE>
<LINE>Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation</LINE>
<LINE>Which they have often made against the senate,</LINE>
<LINE>All cause unborn, could never be the motive</LINE>
<LINE>Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?</LINE>
<LINE>How shall this bisson multitude digest</LINE>
<LINE>The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express</LINE>
<LINE>What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;</LINE>
<LINE>We are the greater poll, and in true fear</LINE>
<LINE>They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase</LINE>
<LINE>The nature of our seats and make the rabble</LINE>
<LINE>Call our cares fears; which will in time</LINE>
<LINE>Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in</LINE>
<LINE>The crows to peck the eagles.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Enough, with over-measure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, take more:</LINE>
<LINE>What may be sworn by, both divine and human,</LINE>
<LINE>Seal what I end withal! This double worship,</LINE>
<LINE>Where one part does disdain with cause, the other</LINE>
<LINE>Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot conclude but by the yea and no</LINE>
<LINE>Of general ignorance,--it must omit</LINE>
<LINE>Real necessities, and give way the while</LINE>
<LINE>To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,</LINE>
<LINE>it follows,</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--</LINE>
<LINE>You that will be less fearful than discreet,</LINE>
<LINE>That love the fundamental part of state</LINE>
<LINE>More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer</LINE>
<LINE>A noble life before a long, and wish</LINE>
<LINE>To jump a body with a dangerous physic</LINE>
<LINE>That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out</LINE>
<LINE>The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick</LINE>
<LINE>The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour</LINE>
<LINE>Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state</LINE>
<LINE>Of that integrity which should become't,</LINE>
<LINE>Not having the power to do the good it would,</LINE>
<LINE>For the in which doth control't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Has said enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer</LINE>
<LINE>As traitors do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!</LINE>
<LINE>What should the people do with these bald tribunes?</LINE>
<LINE>On whom depending, their obedience fails</LINE>
<LINE>To the greater bench: in a rebellion,</LINE>
<LINE>When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,</LINE>
<LINE>Then were they chosen: in a better hour,</LINE>
<LINE>Let what is meet be said it must be meet,</LINE>
<LINE>And throw their power i' the dust.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Manifest treason!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This a consul? no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The aediles, ho!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter an AEdile</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Let him be apprehended.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, call the people:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit AEdile</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>in whose name myself</LINE>
<LINE>Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,</LINE>
<LINE>A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And follow to thine answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hence, old goat!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Senators, C</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We'll surety him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Aged sir, hands off.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones</LINE>
<LINE>Out of thy garments.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Help, ye citizens!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a rabble of Citizens (Plebeians), with
the AEdiles</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>On both sides more respect.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's he that would take from you all your power.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Seize him, AEdiles!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Citizens</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Down with him! down with him!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Senators, C</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Weapons, weapons, weapons!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>They all bustle about CORIOLANUS, crying</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'</LINE>
<LINE>'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'</LINE>
<LINE>'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is about to be? I am out of breath;</LINE>
<LINE>Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes</LINE>
<LINE>To the people! Coriolanus, patience!</LINE>
<LINE>Speak, good Sicinius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear me, people; peace!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Citizens</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are at point to lose your liberties:</LINE>
<LINE>Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom late you have named for consul.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, fie, fie!</LINE>
<LINE>This is the way to kindle, not to quench.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is the city but the people?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Citizens</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True,</LINE>
<LINE>The people are the city.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By the consent of all, we were establish'd</LINE>
<LINE>The people's magistrates.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Citizens</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You so remain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so are like to do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is the way to lay the city flat;</LINE>
<LINE>To bring the roof to the foundation,</LINE>
<LINE>And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,</LINE>
<LINE>In heaps and piles of ruin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This deserves death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or let us stand to our authority,</LINE>
<LINE>Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the part o' the people, in whose power</LINE>
<LINE>We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy</LINE>
<LINE>Of present death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Therefore lay hold of him;</LINE>
<LINE>Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence</LINE>
<LINE>Into destruction cast him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>AEdiles, seize him!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Citizens</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yield, Marcius, yield!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear me one word;</LINE>
<LINE>Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, those cold ways,</LINE>
<LINE>That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His nature is too noble for the world:</LINE>
<LINE>He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,</LINE>

<LINE>And, being angry, does forget that ever</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>A noise within</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You worthy tribunes,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock</LINE>
<LINE>With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore law shall scorn him further trial</LINE>
<LINE>Than the severity of the public power</LINE>
<LINE>Which he so sets at nought.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He shall well know</LINE>
<LINE>The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,</LINE>

<LINE>He shall, sure on't.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt</LINE>
<LINE>With modest warrant.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, how comes't that you</LINE>
<LINE>Have holp to make this rescue?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear me speak:</LINE>
<LINE>As I do know the consul's worthiness,</LINE>
<LINE>So can I name his faults,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Consul! what consul?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The consul Coriolanus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He consul!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Citizens</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no, no, no, no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,</LINE>
<LINE>I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;</LINE>
<LINE>The which shall turn you to no further harm</LINE>
<LINE>Than so much loss of time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak briefly then;</LINE>
<LINE>For we are peremptory to dispatch</LINE>
<LINE>This viperous traitor: to eject him hence</LINE>
<LINE>Were but one danger, and to keep him here</LINE>
<LINE>Our certain death: therefore it is decreed</LINE>
<LINE>He dies to-night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now the good gods forbid</LINE>
<LINE>That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude</LINE>
<LINE>Towards her deserved children is enroll'd</LINE>
<LINE>In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam</LINE>
<LINE>Should now eat up her own!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He's a disease that must be cut away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, he's a limb that has but a disease;</LINE>
<LINE>Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.</LINE>
<LINE>What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?</LINE>
<LINE>Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--</LINE>
<LINE>Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,</LINE>
<LINE>By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;</LINE>
<LINE>And what is left, to lose it by his country,</LINE>
<LINE>Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,</LINE>
<LINE>A brand to the end o' the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is clean kam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Merely awry: when he did love his country,</LINE>
<LINE>It honour'd him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The service of the foot</LINE>
<LINE>Being once gangrened, is not then respected</LINE>
<LINE>For what before it was.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We'll hear no more.</LINE>
<LINE>Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:</LINE>
<LINE>Lest his infection, being of catching nature,</LINE>
<LINE>Spread further.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One word more, one word.</LINE>
<LINE>This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find</LINE>
<LINE>The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late</LINE>
<LINE>Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;</LINE>
<LINE>Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,</LINE>
<LINE>And sack great Rome with Romans.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it were so,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What do ye talk?</LINE>
<LINE>Have we not had a taste of his obedience?</LINE>
<LINE>Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars</LINE>
<LINE>Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd</LINE>
<LINE>In bolted language; meal and bran together</LINE>
<LINE>He throws without distinction. Give me leave,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him</LINE>
<LINE>Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,</LINE>
<LINE>In peace, to his utmost peril.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Noble tribunes,</LINE>
<LINE>It is the humane way: the other course</LINE>
<LINE>Will prove too bloody, and the end of it</LINE>
<LINE>Unknown to the beginning.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Noble Menenius,</LINE>
<LINE>Be you then as the people's officer.</LINE>
<LINE>Masters, lay down your weapons.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go not home.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:</LINE>
<LINE>Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed</LINE>
<LINE>In our first way.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll bring him to you.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To the Senators</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Let me desire your company: he must come,</LINE>
<LINE>Or what is worst will follow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CORIOLANUS with Patricians</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let them puff all about mine ears, present me</LINE>
<LINE>Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,</LINE>
<LINE>Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,</LINE>
<LINE>That the precipitation might down stretch</LINE>
<LINE>Below the beam of sight, yet will I still</LINE>
<LINE>Be thus to them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>A Patrician</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You do the nobler.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I muse my mother</LINE>
<LINE>Does not approve me further, who was wont</LINE>
<LINE>To call them woollen vassals, things created</LINE>
<LINE>To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads</LINE>
<LINE>In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,</LINE>
<LINE>When one but of my ordinance stood up</LINE>
<LINE>To speak of peace or war.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter VOLUMNIA</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I talk of you:</LINE>
<LINE>Why did you wish me milder? would you have me</LINE>
<LINE>False to my nature? Rather say I play</LINE>
<LINE>The man I am.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, sir, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>I would have had you put your power well on,</LINE>
<LINE>Before you had worn it out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You might have been enough the man you are,</LINE>
<LINE>With striving less to be so; lesser had been</LINE>
<LINE>The thwartings of your dispositions, if</LINE>
<LINE>You had not show'd them how ye were disposed</LINE>
<LINE>Ere they lack'd power to cross you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let them hang.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>A Patrician</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and burn too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter MENENIUS and Senators</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, you have been too rough, something</LINE>
<LINE>too rough;</LINE>
<LINE>You must return and mend it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's no remedy;</LINE>
<LINE>Unless, by not so doing, our good city</LINE>
<LINE>Cleave in the midst, and perish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray, be counsell'd:</LINE>
<LINE>I have a heart as little apt as yours,</LINE>
<LINE>But yet a brain that leads my use of anger</LINE>
<LINE>To better vantage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well said, noble woman?</LINE>
<LINE>Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that</LINE>
<LINE>The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic</LINE>
<LINE>For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I can scarcely bear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What must I do?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Return to the tribunes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, what then? what then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Repent what you have spoke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For them! I cannot do it to the gods;</LINE>
<LINE>Must I then do't to them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are too absolute;</LINE>
<LINE>Though therein you can never be too noble,</LINE>
<LINE>But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,</LINE>
<LINE>Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,</LINE>
<LINE>I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,</LINE>
<LINE>In peace what each of them by the other lose,</LINE>
<LINE>That they combine not there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tush, tush!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A good demand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it be honour in your wars to seem</LINE>
<LINE>The same you are not, which, for your best ends,</LINE>
<LINE>You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,</LINE>
<LINE>That it shall hold companionship in peace</LINE>
<LINE>With honour, as in war, since that to both</LINE>
<LINE>It stands in like request?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why force you this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because that now it lies you on to speak</LINE>
<LINE>To the people; not by your own instruction,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,</LINE>
<LINE>But with such words that are but rooted in</LINE>
<LINE>Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables</LINE>
<LINE>Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, this no more dishonours you at all</LINE>
<LINE>Than to take in a town with gentle words,</LINE>
<LINE>Which else would put you to your fortune and</LINE>
<LINE>The hazard of much blood.</LINE>
<LINE>I would dissemble with my nature where</LINE>
<LINE>My fortunes and my friends at stake required</LINE>
<LINE>I should do so in honour: I am in this,</LINE>
<LINE>Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;</LINE>
<LINE>And you will rather show our general louts</LINE>
<LINE>How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,</LINE>
<LINE>For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard</LINE>
<LINE>Of what that want might ruin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Noble lady!</LINE>
<LINE>Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,</LINE>
<LINE>Not what is dangerous present, but the loss</LINE>
<LINE>Of what is past.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prithee now, my son,</LINE>
<LINE>Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;</LINE>
<LINE>And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--</LINE>
<LINE>Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business</LINE>
<LINE>Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant</LINE>
<LINE>More learned than the ears--waving thy head,</LINE>
<LINE>Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Now humble as the ripest mulberry</LINE>
<LINE>That will not hold the handling: or say to them,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils</LINE>
<LINE>Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,</LINE>
<LINE>Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,</LINE>
<LINE>In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame</LINE>
<LINE>Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far</LINE>
<LINE>As thou hast power and person.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This but done,</LINE>
<LINE>Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;</LINE>
<LINE>For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free</LINE>
<LINE>As words to little purpose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee now,</LINE>
<LINE>Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather</LINE>
<LINE>Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf</LINE>
<LINE>Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter COMINIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit</LINE>
<LINE>You make strong party, or defend yourself</LINE>
<LINE>By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Only fair speech.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think 'twill serve, if he</LINE>
<LINE>Can thereto frame his spirit.</LINE>

<LINE>He must, and will</LINE>
<LINE>Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?</LINE>
<LINE>Must I with base tongue give my noble heart</LINE>
<LINE>A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,</LINE>
<LINE>This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it</LINE>
<LINE>And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!</LINE>
<LINE>You have put me now to such a part which never</LINE>
<LINE>I shall discharge to the life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, we'll prompt you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said</LINE>
<LINE>My praises made thee first a soldier, so,</LINE>
<LINE>To have my praise for this, perform a part</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast not done before.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I must do't:</LINE>
<LINE>Away, my disposition, and possess me</LINE>
<LINE>Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Which quired with my drum, into a pipe</LINE>
<LINE>Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice</LINE>
<LINE>That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves</LINE>
<LINE>Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up</LINE>
<LINE>The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,</LINE>
<LINE>Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his</LINE>
<LINE>That hath received an alms! I will not do't,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth</LINE>
<LINE>And by my body's action teach my mind</LINE>
<LINE>A most inherent baseness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At thy choice, then:</LINE>
<LINE>To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour</LINE>
<LINE>Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let</LINE>
<LINE>Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear</LINE>
<LINE>Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death</LINE>
<LINE>With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list</LINE>
<LINE>Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,</LINE>
<LINE>But owe thy pride thyself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray, be content:</LINE>
<LINE>Mother, I am going to the market-place;</LINE>
<LINE>Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,</LINE>
<LINE>Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved</LINE>
<LINE>Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:</LINE>
<LINE>Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;</LINE>
<LINE>Or never trust to what my tongue can do</LINE>
<LINE>I' the way of flattery further.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter an AEdile</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What, will he come?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEdile</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He's coming.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How accompanied?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEdile</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With old Menenius, and those senators</LINE>
<LINE>That always favour'd him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you a catalogue</LINE>
<LINE>Of all the voices that we have procured</LINE>
<LINE>Set down by the poll?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEdile</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have; 'tis ready.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you collected them by tribes?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEdile</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Assemble presently the people hither;</LINE>
<LINE>And when they bear me say 'It shall be so</LINE>
<LINE>I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either</LINE>
<LINE>For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them</LINE>
<LINE>If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'</LINE>
<LINE>Insisting on the old prerogative</LINE>
<LINE>And power i' the truth o' the cause.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEdile</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall inform them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And when such time they have begun to cry,</LINE>
<LINE>Let them not cease, but with a din confused</LINE>
<LINE>Enforce the present execution</LINE>
<LINE>Of what we chance to sentence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEdile</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Make them be strong and ready for this hint,</LINE>
<LINE>When we shall hap to give 't them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go about it.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit AEdile</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Put him to choler straight: he hath been used</LINE>
<LINE>Ever to conquer, and to have his worth</LINE>
<LINE>Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot</LINE>
<LINE>Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks</LINE>
<LINE>What's in his heart; and that is there which looks</LINE>
<LINE>With us to break his neck.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, here he comes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, and COMINIUS,
with Senators and Patricians</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Calmly, I do beseech you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece</LINE>
<LINE>Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods</LINE>
<LINE>Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice</LINE>
<LINE>Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!</LINE>
<LINE>Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,</LINE>
<LINE>And not our streets with war!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen, amen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A noble wish.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter AEdile, with Citizens</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Draw near, ye people.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEdile</SPEAKER>
<LINE>List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, hear me speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Both Tribunes</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, say. Peace, ho!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I be charged no further than this present?</LINE>
<LINE>Must all determine here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do demand,</LINE>
<LINE>If you submit you to the people's voices,</LINE>
<LINE>Allow their officers and are content</LINE>
<LINE>To suffer lawful censure for such faults</LINE>
<LINE>As shall be proved upon you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am content.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lo, citizens, he says he is content:</LINE>
<LINE>The warlike service he has done, consider; think</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the wounds his body bears, which show</LINE>
<LINE>Like graves i' the holy churchyard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Scratches with briers,</LINE>
<LINE>Scars to move laughter only.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Consider further,</LINE>
<LINE>That when he speaks not like a citizen,</LINE>
<LINE>You find him like a soldier: do not take</LINE>
<LINE>His rougher accents for malicious sounds,</LINE>
<LINE>But, as I say, such as become a soldier,</LINE>
<LINE>Rather than envy you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, well, no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is the matter</LINE>
<LINE>That being pass'd for consul with full voice,</LINE>
<LINE>I am so dishonour'd that the very hour</LINE>
<LINE>You take it off again?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Answer to us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We charge you, that you have contrived to take</LINE>
<LINE>From Rome all season'd office and to wind</LINE>
<LINE>Yourself into a power tyrannical;</LINE>
<LINE>For which you are a traitor to the people.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How! traitor!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, temperately; your promise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!</LINE>
<LINE>Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!</LINE>
<LINE>Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,</LINE>
<LINE>In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in</LINE>
<LINE>Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say</LINE>
<LINE>'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free</LINE>
<LINE>As I do pray the gods.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mark you this, people?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Citizens</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To the rock, to the rock with him!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace!</LINE>
<LINE>We need not put new matter to his charge:</LINE>
<LINE>What you have seen him do and heard him speak,</LINE>
<LINE>Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,</LINE>
<LINE>Opposing laws with strokes and here defying</LINE>
<LINE>Those whose great power must try him; even this,</LINE>
<LINE>So criminal and in such capital kind,</LINE>
<LINE>Deserves the extremest death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But since he hath</LINE>
<LINE>Served well for Rome,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What do you prate of service?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I talk of that, that know it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is this the promise that you made your mother?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Know, I pray you,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know no further:</LINE>
<LINE>Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,</LINE>
<LINE>Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger</LINE>
<LINE>But with a grain a day, I would not buy</LINE>
<LINE>Their mercy at the price of one fair word;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,</LINE>
<LINE>To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For that he has,</LINE>
<LINE>As much as in him lies, from time to time</LINE>
<LINE>Envied against the people, seeking means</LINE>
<LINE>To pluck away their power, as now at last</LINE>
<LINE>Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence</LINE>
<LINE>Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers</LINE>
<LINE>That do distribute it; in the name o' the people</LINE>
<LINE>And in the power of us the tribunes, we,</LINE>
<LINE>Even from this instant, banish him our city,</LINE>
<LINE>In peril of precipitation</LINE>
<LINE>From off the rock Tarpeian never more</LINE>
<LINE>To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,</LINE>
<LINE>I say it shall be so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He's sentenced; no more hearing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me speak:</LINE>
<LINE>I have been consul, and can show for Rome</LINE>
<LINE>Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love</LINE>
<LINE>My country's good with a respect more tender,</LINE>
<LINE>More holy and profound, than mine own life,</LINE>
<LINE>My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,</LINE>
<LINE>And treasure of my loins; then if I would</LINE>
<LINE>Speak that,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We know your drift: speak what?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,</LINE>
<LINE>As enemy to the people and his country:</LINE>

<LINE>As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize</LINE>
<LINE>As the dead carcasses of unburied men</LINE>
<LINE>That do corrupt my air, I banish you;</LINE>
<LINE>And here remain with your uncertainty!</LINE>
<LINE>Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!</LINE>
<LINE>Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,</LINE>
<LINE>Fan you into despair! Have the power still</LINE>
<LINE>To banish your defenders; till at length</LINE>
<LINE>Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,</LINE>
<LINE>Making not reservation of yourselves,</LINE>
<LINE>Still your own foes, deliver you as most</LINE>
<LINE>Abated captives to some nation</LINE>
<LINE>That won you without blows! Despising,</LINE>
<LINE>For you, the city, thus I turn my back:</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast</LINE>
<LINE>With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,</LINE>
<LINE>Where is your ancient courage? you were used</LINE>
<LINE>To say extremity was the trier of spirits;</LINE>
<LINE>That common chances common men could bear;</LINE>
<LINE>That when the sea was calm all boats alike</LINE>
<LINE>Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,</LINE>
<LINE>When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves</LINE>
<LINE>A noble cunning: you were used to load me</LINE>

<LINE>What, what, what!</LINE>
<LINE>I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.</LINE>
<LINE>Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,</LINE>
<LINE>If you had been the wife of Hercules,</LINE>
<LINE>Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved</LINE>
<LINE>Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,</LINE>
<LINE>Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,</LINE>
<LINE>And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,</LINE>
<LINE>I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld</LINE>
<LINE>Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,</LINE>
<LINE>As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well</LINE>
<LINE>My hazards still have been your solace: and</LINE>
<LINE>Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen</LINE>
<LINE>Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son</LINE>
<LINE>Will or exceed the common or be caught</LINE>
<LINE>With cautelous baits and practise.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My first son.</LINE>
<LINE>Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius</LINE>

<LINE>A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send</LINE>
<LINE>O'er the vast world to seek a single man,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fare ye well:</LINE>

<LINE>Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and</LINE>
<LINE>My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,</LINE>
<LINE>Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.</LINE>
<LINE>While I remain above the ground, you shall</LINE>

<LINE>news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,</LINE>
<LINE>to find you out there: you have well saved me a</LINE>
<LINE>day's journey.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Roman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the</LINE>
<LINE>people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Volsce</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not</LINE>
<LINE>so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and</LINE>
<LINE>hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Roman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing</LINE>
<LINE>would make it flame again: for the nobles receive</LINE>
<LINE>so to heart the banishment of that worthy</LINE>
<LINE>Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take</LINE>
<LINE>all power from the people and to pluck from them</LINE>
<LINE>their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can</LINE>
<LINE>tell you, and is almost mature for the violent</LINE>
<LINE>breaking out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Volsce</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Coriolanus banished!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Roman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Banished, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Volsce</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Roman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The day serves well for them now. I have heard it</LINE>
<LINE>said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is</LINE>
<LINE>when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble</LINE>
<LINE>Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his</LINE>
<LINE>great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request</LINE>
<LINE>of his country.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Volsce</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus</LINE>
<LINE>accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my</LINE>
<LINE>business, and I will merrily accompany you home.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Roman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall, between this and supper, tell you most</LINE>
<LINE>strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of</LINE>
<LINE>their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Volsce</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,</LINE>
<LINE>distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,</LINE>
<LINE>and to be on foot at an hour's warning.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Roman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the</LINE>
<LINE>man, I think, that shall set them in present action.</LINE>
<LINE>So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Volsce</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause</LINE>
<LINE>to be glad of yours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Roman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, let us go together.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A goodly city is this Antium. City,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir</LINE>
<LINE>Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars</LINE>
<LINE>Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones</LINE>
<LINE>In puny battle slay me.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter a Citizen</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Save you, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is, and feasts the nobles of the state</LINE>

<LINE>O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,</LINE>
<LINE>Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love</LINE>
<LINE>Unseparable, shall within this hour,</LINE>
<LINE>On a dissension of a doit, break out</LINE>
<LINE>To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>To take the one the other, by some chance,</LINE>
<LINE>Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends</LINE>
<LINE>And interjoin their issues. So with me:</LINE>
<LINE>My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon</LINE>
<LINE>This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,</LINE>
<LINE>He does fair justice; if he give me way,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll do his country service.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy</LINE>

<LINE>Where is this fellow?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for</LINE>
<LINE>disturbing the lords within.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Retires</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?</LINE>
<LINE>Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If, Tullus,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Unmuffling</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not</LINE>
<LINE>Think me for the man I am, necessity</LINE>
<LINE>Commands me name myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is thy name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,</LINE>
<LINE>And harsh in sound to thine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, what's thy name?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face</LINE>
<LINE>Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st</LINE>
<LINE>thou me yet?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know thee not: thy name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done</LINE>
<LINE>To thee particularly and to all the Volsces</LINE>
<LINE>Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may</LINE>
<LINE>My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,</LINE>
<LINE>The extreme dangers and the drops of blood</LINE>
<LINE>Shed for my thankless country are requited</LINE>
<LINE>But with that surname; a good memory,</LINE>
<LINE>And witness of the malice and displeasure</LINE>
<LINE>Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;</LINE>
<LINE>The cruelty and envy of the people,</LINE>
<LINE>Permitted by our dastard nobles, who</LINE>
<LINE>Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;</LINE>
<LINE>And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be</LINE>
<LINE>Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity</LINE>
<LINE>Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--</LINE>
<LINE>Mistake me not--to save my life, for if</LINE>
<LINE>I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world</LINE>
<LINE>I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,</LINE>
<LINE>To be full quit of those my banishers,</LINE>
<LINE>Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast</LINE>
<LINE>A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge</LINE>
<LINE>Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims</LINE>
<LINE>Of shame seen through thy country, speed</LINE>
<LINE>thee straight,</LINE>
<LINE>And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it</LINE>
<LINE>That my revengeful services may prove</LINE>
<LINE>As benefits to thee, for I will fight</LINE>
<LINE>Against my canker'd country with the spleen</LINE>
<LINE>Of all the under fiends. But if so be</LINE>
<LINE>Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes</LINE>
<LINE>Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am</LINE>
<LINE>Longer to live most weary, and present</LINE>
<LINE>My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;</LINE>
<LINE>Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,</LINE>
<LINE>Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,</LINE>
<LINE>Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,</LINE>
<LINE>And cannot live but to thy shame, unless</LINE>
<LINE>It be to do thee service.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Marcius, Marcius!</LINE>
<LINE>Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart</LINE>
<LINE>A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter</LINE>
<LINE>Should from yond cloud speak divine things,</LINE>
<LINE>And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more</LINE>
<LINE>Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine</LINE>
<LINE>Mine arms about that body, where against</LINE>
<LINE>My grained ash an hundred times hath broke</LINE>
<LINE>And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip</LINE>
<LINE>The anvil of my sword, and do contest</LINE>
<LINE>As hotly and as nobly with thy love</LINE>
<LINE>As ever in ambitious strength I did</LINE>
<LINE>Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,</LINE>
<LINE>I loved the maid I married; never man</LINE>
<LINE>Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart</LINE>
<LINE>Than when I first my wedded mistress saw</LINE>
<LINE>Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,</LINE>
<LINE>We have a power on foot; and I had purpose</LINE>
<LINE>Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,</LINE>
<LINE>Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out</LINE>
<LINE>Twelve several times, and I have nightly since</LINE>
<LINE>Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;</LINE>
<LINE>We have been down together in my sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,</LINE>
<LINE>And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,</LINE>
<LINE>Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all</LINE>
<LINE>From twelve to seventy, and pouring war</LINE>
<LINE>Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,</LINE>
<LINE>And take our friendly senators by the hands;</LINE>
<LINE>Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,</LINE>
<LINE>Who am prepared against your territories,</LINE>
<LINE>Though not for Rome itself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You bless me, gods!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have</LINE>
<LINE>The leading of thine own revenges, take</LINE>
<LINE>The one half of my commission; and set down--</LINE>
<LINE>As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st</LINE>
<LINE>Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;</LINE>
<LINE>Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>Or rudely visit them in parts remote,</LINE>
<LINE>To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:</LINE>
<LINE>Let me commend thee first to those that shall</LINE>
<LINE>Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!</LINE>
<LINE>And more a friend than e'er an enemy;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS. The two
Servingmen come forward</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's a strange alteration!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with</LINE>
<LINE>a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a</LINE>
<LINE>false report of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What an arm he has! he turned me about with his</LINE>
<LINE>finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in</LINE>
<LINE>him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I</LINE>
<LINE>cannot tell how to term it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,</LINE>
<LINE>but I thought there was more in him than I could think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest</LINE>
<LINE>man i' the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who, my master?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, it's no matter for that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Worth six on him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the</LINE>
<LINE>greater soldier.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:</LINE>
<LINE>for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and for an assault too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Re-enter third Servingman</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servingman</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>Second Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, what, what? let's partake.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as</LINE>
<LINE>lieve be a condemned man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servingman</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>Second Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherefore? wherefore?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,</LINE>
<LINE>Caius Marcius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why do you say 'thwack our general '?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always</LINE>
<LINE>good enough for him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too</LINE>
<LINE>hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth</LINE>
<LINE>on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched</LINE>
<LINE>him like a carbon ado.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An he had been cannibally given, he might have</LINE>
<LINE>broiled and eaten him too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, more of thy news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son</LINE>
<LINE>and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no</LINE>
<LINE>question asked him by any of the senators, but they</LINE>
<LINE>stand bald before him: our general himself makes a</LINE>
<LINE>mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and</LINE>
<LINE>turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But</LINE>
<LINE>the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'</LINE>
<LINE>the middle and but one half of what he was</LINE>
<LINE>yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty</LINE>
<LINE>and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,</LINE>
<LINE>and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he</LINE>
<LINE>will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as</LINE>
<LINE>many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it</LINE>
<LINE>were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as</LINE>
<LINE>we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Directitude! what's that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,</LINE>
<LINE>and the man in blood, they will out of their</LINE>
<LINE>burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with</LINE>
<LINE>him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But when goes this forward?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the</LINE>
<LINE>drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a</LINE>
<LINE>parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they</LINE>
<LINE>wipe their lips.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.</LINE>
<LINE>This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase</LINE>
<LINE>tailors, and breed ballad-makers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servingman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as</LINE>
<LINE>day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and</LINE>
<LINE>full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;</LINE>
<LINE>mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more</LINE>
<LINE>bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;</LINE>
<LINE>His remedies are tame i' the present peace</LINE>
<LINE>And quietness of the people, which before</LINE>
<LINE>Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends</LINE>
<LINE>Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,</LINE>
<LINE>Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold</LINE>
<LINE>Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see</LINE>
<LINE>Our tradesmen with in their shops and going</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your Coriolanus</LINE>
<LINE>Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:</LINE>
<LINE>The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,</LINE>
<LINE>Were he more angry at it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All's well; and might have been much better, if</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is a happier and more comely time</LINE>
<LINE>Than when these fellows ran about the streets,</LINE>
<LINE>Crying confusion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Caius Marcius was</LINE>
<LINE>A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,</LINE>
<LINE>O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,</LINE>
<LINE>Self-loving,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And affecting one sole throne,</LINE>
<LINE>Without assistance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think not so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We should by this, to all our lamentation,</LINE>
<LINE>If he had gone forth consul, found it so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The gods have well prevented it, and Rome</LINE>
<LINE>Sits safe and still without him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter an AEdile</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEdile</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Worthy tribunes,</LINE>
<LINE>There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,</LINE>
<LINE>Reports, the Volsces with two several powers</LINE>
<LINE>Are enter'd in the Roman territories,</LINE>
<LINE>And with the deepest malice of the war</LINE>
<LINE>Destroy what lies before 'em.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis Aufidius,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,</LINE>
<LINE>Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;</LINE>
<LINE>Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>And durst not once peep out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, what talk you</LINE>
<LINE>Of Marcius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be</LINE>
<LINE>The Volsces dare break with us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cannot be!</LINE>
<LINE>We have record that very well it can,</LINE>
<LINE>And three examples of the like have been</LINE>
<LINE>Within my age. But reason with the fellow,</LINE>
<LINE>Before you punish him, where he heard this,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest you shall chance to whip your information</LINE>
<LINE>And beat the messenger who bids beware</LINE>
<LINE>Of what is to be dreaded.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell not me:</LINE>
<LINE>I know this cannot be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not possible.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The nobles in great earnestness are going</LINE>
<LINE>All to the senate-house: some news is come</LINE>
<LINE>That turns their countenances.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis this slave;--</LINE>
<LINE>Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing but his report.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, worthy sir,</LINE>
<LINE>The slave's report is seconded; and more,</LINE>
<LINE>More fearful, is deliver'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What more fearful?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is spoke freely out of many mouths--</LINE>
<LINE>How probable I do not know--that Marcius,</LINE>
<LINE>Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>And vows revenge as spacious as between</LINE>
<LINE>The young'st and oldest thing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is most likely!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish</LINE>
<LINE>Good Marcius home again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The very trick on't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is unlikely:</LINE>
<LINE>He and Aufidius can no more atone</LINE>
<LINE>Than violentest contrariety.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a second Messenger</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are sent for to the senate:</LINE>
<LINE>A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius</LINE>
<LINE>Associated with Aufidius, rages</LINE>
<LINE>Upon our territories; and have already</LINE>
<LINE>O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took</LINE>
<LINE>What lay before them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter COMINIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, you have made good work!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What news? what news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have holp to ravish your own daughters and</LINE>
<LINE>To melt the city leads upon your pates,</LINE>
<LINE>To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's the news? what's the news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your temples burned in their cement, and</LINE>
<LINE>Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined</LINE>
<LINE>Into an auger's bore.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray now, your news?</LINE>
<LINE>You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--</LINE>
<LINE>If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If!</LINE>
<LINE>He is their god: he leads them like a thing</LINE>
<LINE>Made by some other deity than nature,</LINE>
<LINE>That shapes man better; and they follow him,</LINE>
<LINE>Against us brats, with no less confidence</LINE>
<LINE>Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,</LINE>
<LINE>Or butchers killing flies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have made good work,</LINE>
<LINE>You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much</LINE>
<LINE>on the voice of occupation and</LINE>
<LINE>The breath of garlic-eaters!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He will shake</LINE>
<LINE>Your Rome about your ears.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As Hercules</LINE>
<LINE>Did shake down mellow fruit.</LINE>
<LINE>You have made fair work!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But is this true, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay; and you'll look pale</LINE>
<LINE>Before you find it other. All the regions</LINE>
<LINE>Do smilingly revolt; and who resist</LINE>
<LINE>Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,</LINE>
<LINE>And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?</LINE>
<LINE>Your enemies and his find something in him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are all undone, unless</LINE>
<LINE>The noble man have mercy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who shall ask it?</LINE>
<LINE>The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people</LINE>
<LINE>Deserve such pity of him as the wolf</LINE>
<LINE>Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they</LINE>
<LINE>Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even</LINE>
<LINE>As those should do that had deserved his hate,</LINE>
<LINE>And therein show'd like enemies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis true:</LINE>
<LINE>If he were putting to my house the brand</LINE>
<LINE>That should consume it, I have not the face</LINE>
<LINE>To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,</LINE>
<LINE>You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have brought</LINE>
<LINE>A trembling upon Rome, such as was never</LINE>
<LINE>So incapable of help.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Both Tribunes</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say not we brought it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts</LINE>
<LINE>And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,</LINE>
<LINE>Who did hoot him out o' the city.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I fear</LINE>
<LINE>They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,</LINE>
<LINE>The second name of men, obeys his points</LINE>
<LINE>As if he were his officer: desperation</LINE>
<LINE>Is all the policy, strength and defence,</LINE>
<LINE>That Rome can make against them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a troop of Citizens</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here come the clusters.</LINE>
<LINE>And is Aufidius with him? You are they</LINE>
<LINE>That made the air unwholesome, when you cast</LINE>
<LINE>Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at</LINE>
<LINE>Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;</LINE>
<LINE>And not a hair upon a soldier's head</LINE>
<LINE>Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs</LINE>
<LINE>As you threw caps up will he tumble down,</LINE>
<LINE>And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;</LINE>
<LINE>if he could burn us all into one coal,</LINE>
<LINE>We have deserved it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Citizens</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, we hear fearful news.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>For mine own part,</LINE>
<LINE>When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so did I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Citizen</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very</LINE>
<LINE>many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and</LINE>
<LINE>though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet</LINE>
<LINE>it was against our will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Ye re goodly things, you voices!</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>So did we all. But, come, let's home.</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE VII.  A camp, at a small distance from Rome.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter AUFIDIUS and his Lieutenant</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do they still fly to the Roman?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lieutenant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but</LINE>
<LINE>Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,</LINE>
<LINE>Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;</LINE>
<LINE>And you are darken'd in this action, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Even by your own.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot help it now,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless, by using means, I lame the foot</LINE>
<LINE>Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,</LINE>
<LINE>Even to my person, than I thought he would</LINE>
<LINE>When first I did embrace him: yet his nature</LINE>
<LINE>In that's no changeling; and I must excuse</LINE>
<LINE>What cannot be amended.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lieutenant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet I wish, sir,--</LINE>
<LINE>I mean for your particular,--you had not</LINE>
<LINE>Join'd in commission with him; but either</LINE>
<LINE>Had borne the action of yourself, or else</LINE>
<LINE>To him had left it solely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I understand thee well; and be thou sure,</LINE>
<LINE>when he shall come to his account, he knows not</LINE>
<LINE>What I can urge against him. Although it seems,</LINE>
<LINE>And so he thinks, and is no less apparent</LINE>
<LINE>To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.</LINE>
<LINE>And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,</LINE>
<LINE>Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon</LINE>
<LINE>As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone</LINE>
<LINE>That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,</LINE>
<LINE>Whene'er we come to our account.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lieutenant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All places yield to him ere he sits down;</LINE>
<LINE>And the nobility of Rome are his:</LINE>
<LINE>The senators and patricians love him too:</LINE>
<LINE>The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people</LINE>
<LINE>Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty</LINE>
<LINE>To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome</LINE>
<LINE>As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it</LINE>
<LINE>By sovereignty of nature. First he was</LINE>
<LINE>A noble servant to them; but he could not</LINE>
<LINE>Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,</LINE>
<LINE>Which out of daily fortune ever taints</LINE>
<LINE>The happy man; whether defect of judgment,</LINE>
<LINE>To fail in the disposing of those chances</LINE>
<LINE>Which he was lord of; or whether nature,</LINE>
<LINE>Not to be other than one thing, not moving</LINE>
<LINE>From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace</LINE>
<LINE>Even with the same austerity and garb</LINE>
<LINE>As he controll'd the war; but one of these--</LINE>
<LINE>As he hath spices of them all, not all,</LINE>
<LINE>For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,</LINE>
<LINE>So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,</LINE>
<LINE>To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues</LINE>
<LINE>Lie in the interpretation of the time:</LINE>
<LINE>And power, unto itself most commendable,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair</LINE>
<LINE>To extol what it hath done.</LINE>
<LINE>One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;</LINE>
<LINE>Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter MENENIUS, COMINIUS, SICINIUS, BRUTUS,
and others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said</LINE>
<LINE>Which was sometime his general; who loved him</LINE>
<LINE>In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:</LINE>
<LINE>But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;</LINE>
<LINE>A mile before his tent fall down, and knee</LINE>
<LINE>The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd</LINE>
<LINE>To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He would not seem to know me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you hear?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet one time he did call me by my name:</LINE>
<LINE>I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops</LINE>
<LINE>That we have bled together. Coriolanus</LINE>
<LINE>He would not answer to: forbad all names;</LINE>
<LINE>He was a kind of nothing, titleless,</LINE>
<LINE>Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire</LINE>
<LINE>Of burning Rome.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, so: you have made good work!</LINE>
<LINE>A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon</LINE>
<LINE>When it was less expected: he replied,</LINE>
<LINE>It was a bare petition of a state</LINE>
<LINE>To one whom they had punish'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very well:</LINE>
<LINE>Could he say less?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I offer'd to awaken his regard</LINE>
<LINE>For's private friends: his answer to me was,</LINE>
<LINE>He could not stay to pick them in a pile</LINE>
<LINE>Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,</LINE>
<LINE>For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,</LINE>
<LINE>And still to nose the offence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For one poor grain or two!</LINE>
<LINE>I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,</LINE>
<LINE>And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:</LINE>
<LINE>You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt</LINE>
<LINE>Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid</LINE>
<LINE>In this so never-needed help, yet do not</LINE>
<LINE>Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you</LINE>
<LINE>Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>More than the instant army we can make,</LINE>
<LINE>Might stop our countryman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, I'll not meddle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What should I do?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Only make trial what your love can do</LINE>
<LINE>For Rome, towards Marcius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, and say that Marcius</LINE>
<LINE>Return me, as Cominius is return'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Unheard; what then?</LINE>
<LINE>But as a discontented friend, grief-shot</LINE>
<LINE>With his unkindness? say't be so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet your good will</LINE>
<LINE>must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure</LINE>
<LINE>As you intended well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll undertake 't:</LINE>
<LINE>I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip</LINE>
<LINE>And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.</LINE>
<LINE>He was not taken well; he had not dined:</LINE>
<LINE>The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then</LINE>
<LINE>We pout upon the morning, are unapt</LINE>
<LINE>To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd</LINE>
<LINE>These and these conveyances of our blood</LINE>
<LINE>With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls</LINE>
<LINE>Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him</LINE>
<LINE>Till he be dieted to my request,</LINE>
<LINE>And then I'll set upon him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You know the very road into his kindness,</LINE>
<LINE>And cannot lose your way.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good faith, I'll prove him,</LINE>
<LINE>Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge</LINE>
<LINE>Of my success.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He'll never hear him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COMINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye</LINE>
<LINE>Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury</LINE>
<LINE>The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;</LINE>
<LINE>'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me</LINE>
<LINE>Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,</LINE>
<LINE>He sent in writing after me; what he would not,</LINE>
<LINE>Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:</LINE>
<LINE>So that all hope is vain.</LINE>
<LINE>Unless his noble mother, and his wife;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him</LINE>
<LINE>For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,</LINE>
<LINE>And with our fair entreaties haste them on.</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  Entrance of the Volscian camp before Rome. Two Sentinels on guard.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter to them, MENENIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay: whence are you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand, and go back.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,</LINE>
<LINE>I am an officer of state, and come</LINE>
<LINE>To speak with Coriolanus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From whence?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From Rome.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may not pass, you must return: our general</LINE>
<LINE>Will no more hear from thence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before</LINE>
<LINE>You'll speak with Coriolanus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good my friends,</LINE>
<LINE>If you have heard your general talk of Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,</LINE>
<LINE>My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name</LINE>
<LINE>Is not here passable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I tell thee, fellow,</LINE>
<LINE>The general is my lover: I have been</LINE>
<LINE>The book of his good acts, whence men have read</LINE>
<LINE>His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;</LINE>
<LINE>For I have ever verified my friends,</LINE>
<LINE>Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity</LINE>
<LINE>Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,</LINE>
<LINE>I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise</LINE>
<LINE>Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,</LINE>
<LINE>I must have leave to pass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his</LINE>
<LINE>behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you</LINE>
<LINE>should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous</LINE>
<LINE>to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,</LINE>
<LINE>always factionary on the party of your general.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you</LINE>
<LINE>have, I am one that, telling true under him, must</LINE>
<LINE>say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not</LINE>
<LINE>speak with him till after dinner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are a Roman, are you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am, as thy general is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,</LINE>
<LINE>when you have pushed out your gates the very</LINE>
<LINE>defender of them, and, in a violent popular</LINE>
<LINE>ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to</LINE>
<LINE>front his revenges with the easy groans of old</LINE>
<LINE>women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with</LINE>
<LINE>the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as</LINE>
<LINE>you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the</LINE>
<LINE>intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with</LINE>
<LINE>such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;</LINE>
<LINE>therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your</LINE>
<LINE>execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn</LINE>
<LINE>you out of reprieve and pardon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would</LINE>
<LINE>use me with estimation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, my captain knows you not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I mean, thy general.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest</LINE>
<LINE>I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's</LINE>
<LINE>the utmost of your having: back.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:</LINE>
<LINE>You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall</LINE>
<LINE>perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from</LINE>
<LINE>my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment</LINE>
<LINE>with him, if thou standest not i' the state of</LINE>
<LINE>hanging, or of some death more long in</LINE>
<LINE>spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now</LINE>
<LINE>presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To CORIOLANUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy</LINE>
<LINE>particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than</LINE>
<LINE>thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!</LINE>
<LINE>thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's</LINE>
<LINE>water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to</LINE>
<LINE>thee; but being assured none but myself could move</LINE>
<LINE>thee, I have been blown out of your gates with</LINE>
<LINE>sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy</LINE>
<LINE>petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy</LINE>
<LINE>wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet</LINE>
<LINE>here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my</LINE>
<LINE>access to thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How! away!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs</LINE>
<LINE>Are servanted to others: though I owe</LINE>
<LINE>My revenge properly, my remission lies</LINE>
<LINE>In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,</LINE>
<LINE>Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather</LINE>
<LINE>Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.</LINE>
<LINE>Mine ears against your suits are stronger than</LINE>
<LINE>Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Take this along; I writ it for thy sake</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Gives a letter</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,</LINE>
<LINE>I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,</LINE>
<LINE>Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You keep a constant temper.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, sir, is your name Menenius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the</LINE>
<LINE>way home again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your</LINE>
<LINE>greatness back?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I neither care for the world nor your general: for</LINE>
<LINE>such things as you, I can scarce think there's any,</LINE>
<LINE>ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by</LINE>
<LINE>himself fears it not from another: let your general</LINE>
<LINE>do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and</LINE>
<LINE>your misery increase with your age! I say to you,</LINE>
<LINE>as I was said to, Away!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEAKER>First Senator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A noble fellow, I warrant him.</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE III.  The tent of Coriolanus.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter CORIOLANUS, AUFIDIUS, and others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow</LINE>
<LINE>Set down our host. My partner in this action,</LINE>
<LINE>You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly</LINE>
<LINE>I have borne this business.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Only their ends</LINE>
<LINE>You have respected; stopp'd your ears against</LINE>
<LINE>The general suit of Rome; never admitted</LINE>
<LINE>A private whisper, no, not with such friends</LINE>
<LINE>That thought them sure of you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This last old man,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>Loved me above the measure of a father;</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge</LINE>
<LINE>Was to send him; for whose old love I have,</LINE>
<LINE>Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd</LINE>
<LINE>The first conditions, which they did refuse</LINE>
<LINE>And cannot now accept; to grace him only</LINE>
<LINE>That thought he could do more, a very little</LINE>
<LINE>I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter</LINE>
<LINE>Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Shout within</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow</LINE>
<LINE>In the same time 'tis made? I will not.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter in mourning habits, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA,
leading young MARCIUS, VALERIA, and Attendants</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand</LINE>
<LINE>The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!</LINE>
<LINE>All bond and privilege of nature, break!</LINE>
<LINE>Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.</LINE>
<LINE>What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not</LINE>
<LINE>Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;</LINE>
<LINE>As if Olympus to a molehill should</LINE>
<LINE>In supplication nod: and my young boy</LINE>
<LINE>Hath an aspect of intercession, which</LINE>
<LINE>Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces</LINE>
<LINE>Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never</LINE>
<LINE>Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,</LINE>
<LINE>As if a man were author of himself</LINE>
<LINE>And knew no other kin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIRGILIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord and husband!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIRGILIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The sorrow that delivers us thus changed</LINE>
<LINE>Makes you think so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Like a dull actor now,</LINE>
<LINE>I have forgot my part, and I am out,</LINE>
<LINE>Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,</LINE>
<LINE>Forgive my tyranny; but do not say</LINE>
<LINE>For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss</LINE>
<LINE>Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!</LINE>
<LINE>Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss</LINE>
<LINE>I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip</LINE>
<LINE>Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,</LINE>
<LINE>And the most noble mother of the world</LINE>
<LINE>Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Kneels</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Of thy deep duty more impression show</LINE>
<LINE>Than that of common sons.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, stand up blest!</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,</LINE>
<LINE>I kneel before thee; and unproperly</LINE>
<LINE>Show duty, as mistaken all this while</LINE>
<LINE>Between the child and parent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Kneels</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is this?</LINE>
<LINE>Your knees to me? to your corrected son?</LINE>
<LINE>Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach</LINE>
<LINE>Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds</LINE>
<LINE>Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;</LINE>
<LINE>Murdering impossibility, to make</LINE>
<LINE>What cannot be, slight work.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art my warrior;</LINE>
<LINE>I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The noble sister of Publicola,</LINE>
<LINE>The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle</LINE>
<LINE>That's curdied by the frost from purest snow</LINE>
<LINE>And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is a poor epitome of yours,</LINE>
<LINE>Which by the interpretation of full time</LINE>
<LINE>May show like all yourself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The god of soldiers,</LINE>
<LINE>With the consent of supreme Jove, inform</LINE>
<LINE>Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove</LINE>
<LINE>To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars</LINE>
<LINE>Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,</LINE>
<LINE>And saving those that eye thee!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your knee, sirrah.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's my brave boy!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,</LINE>
<LINE>Are suitors to you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I beseech you, peace:</LINE>
<LINE>Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:</LINE>
<LINE>The thing I have forsworn to grant may never</LINE>
<LINE>Be held by you denials. Do not bid me</LINE>
<LINE>Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate</LINE>
<LINE>Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not</LINE>
<LINE>To ally my rages and revenges with</LINE>
<LINE>Your colder reasons.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, no more, no more!</LINE>
<LINE>You have said you will not grant us any thing;</LINE>
<LINE>For we have nothing else to ask, but that</LINE>
<LINE>Which you deny already: yet we will ask;</LINE>
<LINE>That, if you fail in our request, the blame</LINE>
<LINE>May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll</LINE>
<LINE>Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment</LINE>
<LINE>And state of bodies would bewray what life</LINE>
<LINE>We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself</LINE>
<LINE>How more unfortunate than all living women</LINE>
<LINE>Are we come hither: since that thy sight,</LINE>
<LINE>which should</LINE>
<LINE>Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance</LINE>
<LINE>with comforts,</LINE>
<LINE>Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;</LINE>
<LINE>Making the mother, wife and child to see</LINE>
<LINE>The son, the husband and the father tearing</LINE>
<LINE>His country's bowels out. And to poor we</LINE>
<LINE>Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us</LINE>
<LINE>Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort</LINE>
<LINE>That all but we enjoy; for how can we,</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, how can we for our country pray.</LINE>
<LINE>Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose</LINE>
<LINE>The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,</LINE>
<LINE>Our comfort in the country. We must find</LINE>
<LINE>An evident calamity, though we had</LINE>
<LINE>Our wish, which side should win: for either thou</LINE>
<LINE>Must, as a foreign recreant, be led</LINE>
<LINE>With manacles thorough our streets, or else</LINE>
<LINE>triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,</LINE>
<LINE>And bear the palm for having bravely shed</LINE>
<LINE>Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,</LINE>
<LINE>I purpose not to wait on fortune till</LINE>
<LINE>These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee</LINE>
<LINE>Rather to show a noble grace to both parts</LINE>
<LINE>Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner</LINE>
<LINE>March to assault thy country than to tread--</LINE>
<LINE>Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,</LINE>
<LINE>That brought thee to this world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIRGILIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and mine,</LINE>
<LINE>That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name</LINE>
<LINE>Living to time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Young MARCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A' shall not tread on me;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not of a woman's tenderness to be,</LINE>
<LINE>Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.</LINE>
<LINE>I have sat too long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Rising</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, go not from us thus.</LINE>
<LINE>If it were so that our request did tend</LINE>
<LINE>To save the Romans, thereby to destroy</LINE>
<LINE>The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,</LINE>
<LINE>As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit</LINE>
<LINE>Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces</LINE>
<LINE>May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,</LINE>
<LINE>'This we received;' and each in either side</LINE>
<LINE>Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest</LINE>
<LINE>For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,</LINE>
<LINE>The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,</LINE>
<LINE>That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit</LINE>
<LINE>Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,</LINE>
<LINE>But with his last attempt he wiped it out;</LINE>
<LINE>Destroy'd his country, and his name remains</LINE>
<LINE>To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,</LINE>
<LINE>To imitate the graces of the gods;</LINE>
<LINE>To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt</LINE>
<LINE>That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?</LINE>
<LINE>Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man</LINE>
<LINE>Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:</LINE>
<LINE>He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:</LINE>
<LINE>Perhaps thy childishness will move him more</LINE>
<LINE>Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world</LINE>
<LINE>More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate</LINE>
<LINE>Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life</LINE>
<LINE>Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,</LINE>
<LINE>When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,</LINE>
<LINE>Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,</LINE>
<LINE>Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,</LINE>
<LINE>And spurn me back: but if it be not so,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou restrain'st from me the duty which</LINE>
<LINE>To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:</LINE>
<LINE>Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.</LINE>
<LINE>To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride</LINE>
<LINE>Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;</LINE>
<LINE>This is the last: so we will home to Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:</LINE>
<LINE>This boy, that cannot tell what he would have</LINE>
<LINE>But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,</LINE>
<LINE>Does reason our petition with more strength</LINE>
<LINE>Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:</LINE>
<LINE>This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;</LINE>
<LINE>His wife is in Corioli and his child</LINE>
<LINE>Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:</LINE>
<LINE>I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,</LINE>
<LINE>And then I'll speak a little.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>He holds her by the hand, silent</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O mother, mother!</LINE>
<LINE>What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,</LINE>
<LINE>The gods look down, and this unnatural scene</LINE>
<LINE>They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!</LINE>
<LINE>You have won a happy victory to Rome;</LINE>
<LINE>But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,</LINE>
<LINE>Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,</LINE>
<LINE>If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.</LINE>
<LINE>Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,</LINE>
<LINE>Were you in my stead, would you have heard</LINE>
<LINE>A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I was moved withal.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I dare be sworn you were:</LINE>
<LINE>And, sir, it is no little thing to make</LINE>
<LINE>Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,</LINE>
<LINE>What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,</LINE>
<LINE>Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and</LINE>
<LINE>thy honour</LINE>
<LINE>At difference in thee: out of that I'll work</LINE>
<LINE>Myself a former fortune.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>The Ladies make signs to CORIOLANUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, by and by;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, c</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>But we will drink together; and you shall bear</LINE>
<LINE>A better witness back than words, which we,</LINE>
<LINE>On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve</LINE>
<LINE>To have a temple built you: all the swords</LINE>
<LINE>In Italy, and her confederate arms,</LINE>
<LINE>Could not have made this peace.</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE IV.  Rome. A public place.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond</LINE>
<LINE>corner-stone?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what of that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it be possible for you to displace it with your</LINE>
<LINE>little finger, there is some hope the ladies of</LINE>
<LINE>Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.</LINE>
<LINE>But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are</LINE>
<LINE>sentenced and stay upon execution.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is't possible that so short a time can alter the</LINE>
<LINE>condition of a man!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;</LINE>
<LINE>yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown</LINE>
<LINE>from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a</LINE>
<LINE>creeping thing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He loved his mother dearly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother</LINE>
<LINE>now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness</LINE>
<LINE>of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he</LINE>
<LINE>moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before</LINE>
<LINE>his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with</LINE>
<LINE>his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a</LINE>
<LINE>battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for</LINE>
<LINE>Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with</LINE>
<LINE>his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity</LINE>
<LINE>and a heaven to throne in.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his</LINE>
<LINE>mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy</LINE>
<LINE>in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that</LINE>
<LINE>shall our poor city find: and all this is long of</LINE>
<LINE>you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The gods be good unto us!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto</LINE>
<LINE>us. When we banished him, we respected not them;</LINE>
<LINE>and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:</LINE>
<LINE>The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune</LINE>
<LINE>And hale him up and down, all swearing, if</LINE>
<LINE>The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,</LINE>
<LINE>They'll give him death by inches.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a second Messenger</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's the news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,</LINE>
<LINE>The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:</LINE>
<LINE>A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SICINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Friend,</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As certain as I know the sun is fire:</LINE>
<LINE>Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?</LINE>
<LINE>Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,</LINE>
<LINE>As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Trumpets; hautboys; drums beat; all together</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,</LINE>
<LINE>Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,</LINE>
<LINE>Make the sun dance. Hark you!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>A shout within</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MENENIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is good news:</LINE>
<LINE>I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia</LINE>
<LINE>Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,</LINE>
<LINE>A city full; of tribunes, such as you,</LINE>
<LINE>A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:</LINE>
<LINE>This morning for ten thousand of your throats</LINE>
<LINE>I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Music still, with shouts</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS, with Attendants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:</LINE>
<LINE>Deliver them this paper: having read it,</LINE>
<LINE>Bid them repair to the market place; where I,</LINE>
<LINE>Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,</LINE>
<LINE>Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse</LINE>
<LINE>The city ports by this hath enter'd and</LINE>
<LINE>Intends to appear before the people, hoping</LINE>
<LINE>To purge herself with words: dispatch.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Attendants</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter three or four Conspirators of AUFIDIUS' faction</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Most welcome!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Conspirator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How is it with our general?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even so</LINE>
<LINE>As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,</LINE>
<LINE>And with his charity slain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Conspirator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most noble sir,</LINE>
<LINE>If you do hold the same intent wherein</LINE>
<LINE>You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you</LINE>
<LINE>Of your great danger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I cannot tell:</LINE>
<LINE>We must proceed as we do find the people.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Conspirator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The people will remain uncertain whilst</LINE>
<LINE>'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either</LINE>
<LINE>Makes the survivor heir of all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know it;</LINE>
<LINE>And my pretext to strike at him admits</LINE>
<LINE>A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd</LINE>
<LINE>Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,</LINE>
<LINE>He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,</LINE>
<LINE>Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,</LINE>
<LINE>He bow'd his nature, never known before</LINE>
<LINE>But to be rough, unswayable and free.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Conspirator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, his stoutness</LINE>
<LINE>When he did stand for consul, which he lost</LINE>
<LINE>By lack of stooping,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That I would have spoke of:</LINE>
<LINE>Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;</LINE>
<LINE>Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;</LINE>
<LINE>Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way</LINE>
<LINE>In all his own desires; nay, let him choose</LINE>
<LINE>Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,</LINE>
<LINE>My best and freshest men; served his designments</LINE>
<LINE>In mine own person; holp to reap the fame</LINE>
<LINE>Which he did end all his; and took some pride</LINE>
<LINE>To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,</LINE>
<LINE>I seem'd his follower, not partner, and</LINE>
<LINE>He waged me with his countenance, as if</LINE>
<LINE>I had been mercenary.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Conspirator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So he did, my lord:</LINE>
<LINE>The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,</LINE>
<LINE>When he had carried Rome and that we look'd</LINE>
<LINE>For no less spoil than glory,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There was it:</LINE>
<LINE>For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.</LINE>
<LINE>At a few drops of women's rheum, which are</LINE>
<LINE>As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour</LINE>
<LINE>Of our great action: therefore shall he die,</LINE>
<LINE>And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of
the People</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Conspirator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your native town you enter'd like a post,</LINE>
<LINE>And had no welcomes home: but he returns,</LINE>
<LINE>Splitting the air with noise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Conspirator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And patient fools,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear</LINE>
<LINE>With giving him glory.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Conspirator</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Therefore, at your vantage,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere he express himself, or move the people</LINE>
<LINE>With what he would say, let him feel your sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Which we will second. When he lies along,</LINE>
<LINE>After your way his tale pronounced shall bury</LINE>
<LINE>His reasons with his body.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say no more:</LINE>
<LINE>Here come the lords.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the Lords of the city</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>All The Lords</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are most welcome home.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have not deserved it.</LINE>
<LINE>But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused</LINE>
<LINE>What I have written to you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lords</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And grieve to hear't.</LINE>
<LINE>What faults he made before the last, I think</LINE>
<LINE>Might have found easy fines: but there to end</LINE>
<LINE>Where he was to begin and give away</LINE>
<LINE>The benefit of our levies, answering us</LINE>
<LINE>With our own charge, making a treaty where</LINE>
<LINE>There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He approaches: you shall hear him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and
colours; commoners being with him</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,</LINE>
<LINE>No more infected with my country's love</LINE>
<LINE>Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting</LINE>
<LINE>Under your great command. You are to know</LINE>
<LINE>That prosperously I have attempted and</LINE>
<LINE>With bloody passage led your wars even to</LINE>
<LINE>The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home</LINE>
<LINE>Do more than counterpoise a full third part</LINE>
<LINE>The charges of the action. We have made peace</LINE>
<LINE>With no less honour to the Antiates</LINE>
<LINE>Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,</LINE>
<LINE>Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,</LINE>
<LINE>Together with the seal o' the senate, what</LINE>
<LINE>We have compounded on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Read it not, noble lords;</LINE>
<LINE>But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree</LINE>
<LINE>He hath abused your powers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Traitor! how now!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, traitor, Marcius!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marcius!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think</LINE>
<LINE>I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name</LINE>
<LINE>Coriolanus in Corioli?</LINE>
<LINE>You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously</LINE>
<LINE>He has betray'd your business, and given up,</LINE>
<LINE>For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;</LINE>
<LINE>Breaking his oath and resolution like</LINE>
<LINE>A twist of rotten silk, never admitting</LINE>
<LINE>Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears</LINE>
<LINE>He whined and roar'd away your victory,</LINE>
<LINE>That pages blush'd at him and men of heart</LINE>
<LINE>Look'd wondering each at other.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear'st thou, Mars?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Name not the god, thou boy of tears!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart</LINE>
<LINE>Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!</LINE>
<LINE>Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever</LINE>
<LINE>I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,</LINE>
<LINE>Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--</LINE>
<LINE>Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that</LINE>
<LINE>Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join</LINE>
<LINE>To thrust the lie unto him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, both, and hear me speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,</LINE>
<LINE>Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!</LINE>
<LINE>If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,</LINE>
<LINE>That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I</LINE>
<LINE>Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:</LINE>
<LINE>Alone I did it. Boy!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUFIDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, noble lords,</LINE>
<LINE>Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,</LINE>
<LINE>'Fore your own eyes and ears?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>All Conspirators</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let him die for't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>All The People</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd</LINE>
<LINE>my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin</LINE>
<LINE>Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!</LINE>
<LINE>The man is noble and his fame folds-in</LINE>
<LINE>This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us</LINE>
<LINE>Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,</LINE>
<LINE>And trouble not the peace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CORIOLANUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O that I had him,</LINE>
<LINE>With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,</LINE>

<LINE>Put up your swords.</LINE>

<LINE>My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,</LINE>
<LINE>Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger</LINE>
<LINE>Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice</LINE>
<LINE>That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours</LINE>
<LINE>To call me to your senate, I'll deliver</LINE>
<LINE>Myself your loyal servant, or endure</LINE>
<LINE>Your heaviest censure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bear from hence his body;</LINE>
<LINE>And mourn you for him: let him be regarded</LINE>
<LINE>As the most noble corse that ever herald</LINE>
<LINE>Did follow to his urn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Lord</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:</LINE>
<LINE>Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he</LINE>
